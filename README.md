# Masterarbeit_UZH
This repository contains the code and latex scripts for my master thesis titled: "Investigating the Neuronal Basis of Learning Processes and Memory Formation in Children and Adolescents with Various Psychiatric Disorders"

## Scripts
Matlab was used to generat data tables and for most plots. 
R was used for statistical analysis and extracting information for tables used in the thesis.
Subfolders with scripts contain a main file that calls all relevant scripts and a short documentation of individual scripts. Furthermore, individuals scripts can be excuted on their own but must be adjusted (i.e., setting propert path prefix). 
Scripts can additionally be found in:
- "\\psyger-stor02.d.uzh.ch\methlab\Students\Oliver\script\Final Scripts Matlab"
- "\\psyger-stor02.d.uzh.ch\methlab\Students\Oliver\script\Final Scripts R"
