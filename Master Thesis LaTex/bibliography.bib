  abstract = {Background: The current study presents the results of a meta-analysis of 39 randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of ACT, including 1,821 patients with mental disorders or somatic health problems. Methods: We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Information provided by the Association of Contextual Behavioral Science (ACBS) community was also included. Statistical calculations were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Study quality was rated using a methodology rating form. Results: ACT outperformed control conditions (Hedges’s g = 0.57) at post-treatment and follow-up, in completer and intent-to-treat analyses for primary outcomes. ACT was superior to waitlist (Hedges’s g = 0.82), to psychological placebo (Hedges’s g = 0.51) and to TAU (Hedges’ g = 0.64). ACT was also superior on secondary outcomes (Hedges’s g = 0.30), life satisfaction/quality measures (Hedges’s g = 0.37) and process measures (Hedges’s g = 0. 56) when compared to control conditions. The comparison between ACT and established treatments (i.e., CBT) did not reveal any significant differences between these treatments (p = .140). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ACT is more effective than treatment as usual or placebo and that ACT may be as effective in treating anxiety disorders, depression, addiction, and somatic health problems as established psychological interventions. More research that focuses on quality of life and processes of change is needed to understand the added value of ACT and its trans diagnostic nature.},

  abstract = {The theoretical concepts short-term memory (STM) and working memory (WM) have been used to refer to the maintenance and the maintenance plus manipulation of information, respectively. Although they are conceptually different, the use of the terms STM and WM in literature is not always strict. STM and WM are different theoretical concepts that are assumed to reflect different cognitive functions. However, correlational studies have not been able to separate both constructs consistently and there is evidence for a large or even complete overlap. The emerging view from neurobiological studies is partly different, although there are conceptual problems troubling the interpretation of findings. In this regard, there is a crucial role for the tasks that are used to measure STM or WM (simple and complex span tasks, respectively) and for the cognitive load reflected by factors like attention and processing speed that may covary between and within these tasks. These conceptual issues are discussed based on several abstract models for the relation between STM and WM.},

Although much is known about how attentional control and working memory capacity relate to each other and to constructs like fluid intelligence, little is known about how trial-by-trial fluctuations in attentional engagement impact trial-by-trial working memory performance. Here, we employ a novel whole-report memory task that allowed us to distinguish between varying levels of attentional engagement in humans performing a working memory task. By characterizing low-performance trials, we can distinguish between models in which working memory performance failures are caused by either (1) complete lapses of attention or (2) variations in attentional control. We found that performance failures increase with set-size and strongly predict working memory capacity. Performance variability was best modeled by an attentional control model of attention, not a lapse model. We examined neural signatures of performance failures by measuring EEG activity while participants performed the whole-report task. The number of items correctly recalled in the memory task was predicted by frontal theta power, with decreased frontal theta power associated with poor performance on the task. In addition, we found that poor performance was not explained by failures of sensory encoding; the P1/N1 response and ocular artifact rates were equivalent for high- and low-performance trials. In all, we propose that attentional lapses alone cannot explain individual differences in working memory performance. Instead, we find that graded fluctuations in attentional control better explain the trial-by-trial differences in working memory that we observe.},

Initial development focused on Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, Major Depression, and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. Methods Data were collected from 523 participants (ages 6–17). Parents completed each of the four E-SWAN scales and traditional unidirectional scales addressing the same disorders. Distributional properties, Item Response Theory Analysis (IRT), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess and compare the performance of E-SWAN and traditional scales. Results In contrast to the traditional scales, which exhibited truncated distributions, all four E-SWAN scales had symmetric distributions. IRT analyses indicate the E-SWAN subscales provided reliable information about respondents throughout the population distribution; traditional scales only provided reliable information about respondents at the high end of the distribution. Predictive value for DSM-5 diagnoses was comparable to prior scales. Conclusions E-SWAN bidirectional scales can capture the full spectrum of the population distribution of behavior underlying DSM disorders. The additional information provided can better inform examination of inter-individual variation in population studies, as well as facilitate the identification of factors related to resiliency in clinical samples.},

  abstract = {The argument for a propositional over a pictorial representation for visual imagery has largely taken the form of an attack on the logical coherence of pictorial representations. These attacks have not been valid since one can develop a coherent dual-code model involving pictorial and verbal (nonpropositional) representations. On the other hand, empirical demonstrations that are claimed to support pictorial representations fail to discriminate such representations from propositional ones. It is argued that the failure of the anti- and pro-pictorial arguments stems from a fundamental indeterminancy in deciding issues of representations. It is shown that wide classes of different representations, and in particular propositional vs dual-code models, can be made to yield identical behavior predictions. Criteria such as parsimony and efficiency in addition to prediction of behavior may yield further constraints on representation; and, in particular, it may be possible to establish whether there are 2 codes, one for visual information and one for verbal, or whether there is a single abstract code. It is concluded that barring decisive physiological data, it will not be possible to establish whether an internal representation is pictorial or propositional.

  abstract = {Objective: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show attenuated mean P3 component amplitudes compared to typically developing (TD) children. This finding may be the result of individual differences in P3 amplitudes, P3 latencies, and/or greater single trial variability (STV) in amplitude or latency, suggesting neural ‘‘noise.” Methods: Event related potentials (ERPs) from 75 children with ADHD and 29 TD children were recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Caregivers provided ratings on child ADHD symptoms. Single-trial ERP amplitudes and latencies were extracted from the P3 component time window during a visual oddball task. Additionally, we computed individual-centered and trial-centered P3 amplitudes to account for inter-individual and inter-trial variability in the timing of the P3 peak. Results: In line with prior research, greater ADHD symptom severity was associated with reduced mean P3 amplitude. This correlation was no longer significant after correcting for inter-trial differences in P3 latency. In contrast, greater ADHD symptom severity was associated with reduced STV in P3 amplitude. Conclusions: Our results suggest that attenuated average P3 amplitude in ADHD samples is due to a consistent reduction in strength of the neurophysiological signal at the single trial level, as well as increased inter-trial variability in the timing of P3 peak amplitudes. The traditional method of extracting P3 amplitudes based on a single time window for all trials may not adequately capture variability in P3 latencies associated with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Objective: This article aims to review basic and clinical studies outlining the roles of prefrontal cortical (PFC) networks in the behavior and cognitive functions that are compromised in childhood neurodevelopmental disorders and how these map into the neuroimaging evidence of circuit abnormalities in these disorders. Method: Studies of animals, normally developing children, and patients with neurodevelopmental disorders were reviewed, with focus on neuroimaging studies. Results: The PFC provides “top– down” regulation of attention, inhibition/cognitive control, motivation, and emotion through connections with posterior cortical and subcortical structures. Dorsolateral and inferior PFC regulate attention and cognitive/inhibitory control, whereas orbital and ventromedial structures regulate motivation and affect. PFC circuitries are very sensitive to their neurochemical environment, and small changes in the underlying neurotransmitter systems, e.g. by medications, can produce large effects on mediated function. Neuroimaging studies of children with neurodevelopmental disorders show altered brain structure and function in distinctive circuits respecting this organization. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder show prominent abnormalities in the inferior PFC and its connections to striatal, cerebellar, and parietal regions, whereas children with conduct disorder show alterations in the paralimbic system, comprising ventromedial, lateral orbitofrontal, and superior temporal cortices together with specific underlying limbic regions, regulating motivation and emotion control. Children with major depressive disorder show alterations in ventral orbital and limbic activity, particularly in the left hemisphere, mediating emotions. Finally, children with obsessivecompulsive disorder appear to have a dysregulation in orbito-fronto-striatal inhibitory control pathways, but also deficits in dorsolateral fronto-parietal systems of attention. Conclusions: Altogether, there is a good correspondence between anatomical circuitry mediating compromised functions and patterns of brain structure and function changes in children with neuropsychiatric disorders. Medications may optimize the neurochemical environment in PFC and associated circuitries, and improve structure and function. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.},

  abstract = {A Brain-computer Interface (BCI) can be used as a neurofeedback training tool to improve cognitive performance. BCIs aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the conventional neurofeedback methods by focusing on the self-regulation of individualized neuromarkers rather than generic ones in a graphically appealing training environment. In this work, for the first time, we have modified a widely used P300-based speller BCI and used it as an engaging neurofeedack training game to enhance P300. According to the user's performance the game becomes more difficult in an adaptive manner, requiring the generation of a larger and stronger P300 (i.e., in terms of total energy) in response to target stimuli. Since the P300 is generated naturally without conscious effort in response to a target trial, unlike many rhythm-based neurofeedback tools, the ability to control the proposed P300-based neurofeedback training is obtained after a short calibration without undergoing tedious trial and error sessions. The performance of the proposed neurofeedback training was evaluated over a short time scale (approximately 30 min training) using 28 young adult participants who were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. In summary, our results show that the proposed P300-based BCI neurofeedback training yielded a significant enhancement in the ERP components of the target trials (i.e., 150–550 ms after the onset of stimuli which includes P300) as well as attenuation in the corresponding ERP components of the non-target trials. In addition, more centro-parietal alpha suppression was observed in the experimental group during the neurofeedback training as well as a post-training spatial attention task. Interestingly, a significant improvement in the response time of a spatial attention task performed immediately after the neurofeedback training was observed in the experimental group. This paper, as a proof-of-concept study, suggests that the proposed neurofeedback training tool is a promising tool for improving attention particularly for those who are at risk of attention deficiency.},

These criteria also provide the organising framework for much of the research focussing on these disorders. Study design, recruitment, analysis and theory are largely built on the assumption that diagnostic criteria reflect an underlying reality. However, there is growing concern that this assumption may not be a valid and that an alternative transdiagnostic approach may better serve our understanding of this large heterogeneous population of young people. This review draws on important developments over the past decade that have set the stage for much-needed breakthroughs in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. We evaluate contemporary approaches to study design and recruitment, review the use of data-driven methods to characterise cognition, behaviour and neurobiology, and consider what alternative transdiagnostic models could mean for children and families. This review concludes that an overreliance on ill-fitting diagnostic criteria is impeding progress towards identifying the barriers that children encounter, understanding underpinning mechanisms and finding the best route to supporting them.},

  abstract = {There is a growing body of research that seeks to understand the mechanisms that drive and maintain neurodevelopmental differences, without recourse to conventional diagnostic categories. So called ‘transdiagnostic’ studies change multiple design features, relative to a more conventional case-control design. Different sampling frames, approaches to assessment and analytic frameworks are allowing researchers to explore neurocognitive mechanisms across hitherto accepted diagnostic boundaries. Sensitive measurement, bridging levels of analysis, and capturing developmental change all pose significant challenges to transdiagnostic researchers. However, methods borrowed from elsewhere, allowing researchers to model individual-level data rather than the group average, and a new focus on developing circuits rather than singular brain regions, are bringing fresh mechanistic insights. We argue that a transdiagnostic approach needs to do more than just improve the characterisation of neurodivergent young people; in future it must also incorporate the developmental dynamics that capture how and when neurodevelopmental differences emerge. This crucial step will require methodological innovation. We introduce approaches that are just emerging within the field, which may allow us to do this, including Generative Network Modelling, Impulse Response Analysis, Network Control Theory and Normative Modelling.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of primacy versus recency effects in free recall is suggested to reflect either two distinct memory systems, or the operation of a single system that is modulated by allocation of attention and less vulnerable to interference. Behavioral and event-related brain potential (ERPs) measures were used to investigate the encoding substrates of the serial position curve and subsequent recall in young adults. Participants were instructed to remember lists of words consisting of 12 common nouns each presented once every 1.5 sec, with a recall signal following the last word to indicate that all remembered items should be written on paper. This procedure was repeated for 20 different word lists. Both performance and late ERP amplitudes reflected classic recall serial position effects. Greater recall and larger late positive component amplitudes were obtained for the primacy and recency items, with less recall and smaller amplitudes for the middle words. The late positive component was larger for recalled compared to unrecalled primacy items, but it did not differ between memory performance outcomes for the recency items. The close relationship between the enhanced amplitude and primacy retrieval supports the view that this positive component reflects one of a process series related to attentional gradient and encoding of events for storage in memory. Recency effects appear to index operations determined by the anticipation of the last stimulus presentation, which occurred for both recalled and unrecalled memory items. Theoretical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective:~         Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence—with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies—is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices—automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables—are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

  abstract = {For more than sixty years, the gold standard for assessing aversive conditioning in humans has been the skin conductance response (SCR), which arises from the activation of the peripheral nervous system. Although the SCR has been proven useful, it has some properties that impact the kinds of questions it can be used to answer. In particular, the SCR is slow, reaching a peak 4–5 seconds after stimulus onset, and it decreases in amplitude after a few trials (habituation). The present study asked whether the late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform could be a useful complementary method for assessing aversive conditioning in humans. The SCR and LPP were measured in an aversive conditioning paradigm consisting of three blocks in which one color was paired with a loud noise (CS+) and other colors were not paired with the noise (CS−). Participants also reported the perceived likelihood of being exposed to the noise for each color. Both SCR and LPP were significantly larger on CS+ trials than on CS− trials. However, SCR decreased steeply after the first conditioning block whereas LPP and self-reports were stable over blocks. These results indicate that the LPP can be used to assess aversive conditioning and has several useful properties: 1) it is a direct response of the central nervous system; 2) it is fast, with an onset latency of 300 ms; 3) it does not habituate over time.},

  abstract = {Cognitive skill differences that are apparent early in pre-kindergarten (pre-K) might provide predictive insights into risk for learning difficulties at school entry, particularly around early markers of risk for comorbid difficulties in early math and literacy. Domain-specific abilities (approximate number system or ANS acuity, phonological awareness) and domain-general abilities (working memory, vigilance, executive attention, and nonverbal IQ) were assessed in 493 children at the beginning of pre-K, to better understand how each uniquely contributes to risk for math difficulties (MD), and comorbid math and reading difficulties (MDRD). At the end of pre-K, standardized math and reading tests were used to form three risk groups (MD, MDRD, not-at-risk) with two severity cut points for math and reading (≤25th, ≤16th percentiles). Discriminant function analysis was used to determine whether and in what ways the groups differed on the cognitive variables. Both MD and MDRD-risk groups differentiated from the not-at-risk group on all variables except for ANS acuity, a finding that was convergent across severity cut points. The only significant contrast for ANS acuity emerged between the most severe MD only group and the not-at-risk group. Only vigilance or sustained attention supported the differentiation of MD risk from MDRD risk. Consistent with school-age studies of comorbidity, MDRD risk was also associated with the lowest levels of math and cognitive skills in this pre-kindergarten sample. Results reveal a potential specific role for sustained attention as an early risk factor for comorbid MDRD, a severe form of learning disability.

For example, people value receiving \$100 tomorrow more than receiving \$100 in 10 years. We explored one reason for this tendency (due to Parfit, 1984): In terms of psychological properties, such as beliefs, values, and goals, the decision maker is more closely linked to the person (his or her future self) receiving \$100 tomorrow than to the person receiving \$100 in 10 years. For this reason, he or she prefers his or her nearer self to have the \$100 rather than his or her more remote self. Studies 1 and 2 showed that the greater the rated psychological connection between 2 parts of a participant’s life, the less he or she discounted future monetary and nonmonetary benefits (e.g., good days at work) over that interval. In Studies 3–5, participants read about characters who undergo large life-changing (and connectedness-weakening) events at different points in their lives and then made decisions about the timing of benefits on behalf of these characters. All 5 studies revealed a relation between perceived psychological connectedness and intertemporal choice: Participants preferred benefits to occur before large changes in connectedness but preferred costs to occur after these changes.

The brain, we argue, can be understood as a complex system or network, in which mental states emerge from the interaction between multiple physical and functional levels. Achieving further conceptual progress will crucially depend on broad-scale discussions regarding the properties of cognition and the tools that are currently available or must be developed in order to study mind–brain mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Network approaches that investigate the interaction between symptoms and behaviours have opened new ways of understanding psychological phenomena in health and disorder in recent years. In parallel, network approaches that characterise the interaction between brain regions have become the dominant approach in neuroimaging research. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for combining network psychometrics and network neuroscience. This approach utilises the information from the psychometric network to obtain neural correlates that are associated with each node in the psychometric network (network-based regression). Moreover, we combine the behavioural variables and their neural correlates in a joint network to characterise their interactions. We illustrate the approach by highlighting the interaction between the triad of autistic traits and their resting-state functional connectivity associations. To this end, we utilise data from 172 male autistic participants (10–21 years) from the autism brain data exchange (ABIDE, ABIDE-II) that completed resting-state fMRI and were assessed using the autism diagnostic interview (ADI-R). Our results indicate that the network-based regression approach can uncover both unique and shared neural correlates of behavioural measures. For instance, our example analysis indicates that the overlap between communication and social difficulties is not reflected in the overlap between their functional brain correlates.The article introduces a method to combine common practices in network psychometrics and network neuroimaging. Namely, we use the unique variance in behavioural measures as regressors to identify unique neural correlates. This enables the description of brain-level and behavioural-level data into a joint network while keeping the dimensionality of the results manageable and interpretable. We illustrate this approach by showing the network of autistic traits and their correlates in resting-state functional connectivity.},

  abstract = {Objective: Adolescents with conduct disorder problems are, on average, at increased risk for a variety of unfortunate adult outcomes, including substance dependence. This study was designed to identify the neurophysiological correlates of different categories of conduct disorder problems as well as the relationship between these correlates and the maturational status of the brain. Method: The subjects were 94 males, aged 14–19 years, recruited from the community. None were recruited from treatment or juvenile justice programs. The subjects varied in the type and number of conduct problem behaviors exhibited prior to age 15. Groups were operationally defined by the relative number (0 versus ≥1) of DSMIV conduct disorder diagnostic criteria within each of four categories: rules violations, aggression, deceitfulness/theft, and destructiveness. Age was included as an additional grouping factor. P300 electroencephalographic potentials were recorded while subjects performed a task in which rare auditory stimuli were used to signal a change in stimulus-response mapping during a succeeding set of trials. Results: Analyses revealed that boys with a history of rules violations failed to exhibit the normal maturational increase in P300 amplitude found in boys without a history of rules violations. Topographic analyses of current source densities suggest that the source of the maturational deficit involved P300 generators within the frontal brain. Parietal generators of P300 matured normally. Conclusions: The present results are interpreted as reflecting a decrement in frontal brain maturation among boys potentially at risk for substance dependence, antisocial personality disorder, or other forms of adult psychopathology.

In each case, independent measures of processing efficiency and storage capacity are assessed to determine their relative importance in predicting performance on complex span tasks, which measure working memory capacity. Results show that complex span performance was independently constrained by individual differences in dornain-general processing efficiency and domain-specific storage capacity. Residual variance, which may reflect the ability to coordinate storage and processing, also predicted academic achievement. These results challenge the view that complex span taps, a limited-capacity resource pool shared between processing and storage operations. Rather, they are consistent with a multiple-component model in which separate resource pools support the processing and storage functions of working memory.

This study aims to examine similarities and differences between cognitive profiles of children with ADHD + SLD, children with SLD only, and a control group to find out whether specific or shared deficits can be identified for the groups. We compared the WISC-V profiles of 62 children with ADHD and SLD (19 girls, M-age = 10.44; SD = 2.44), 35 children with SLD (13 girls, M-age = 10.21; SD = 2.11) and 62 control children without ADHD or SLD (19 girls, M-age = 10.42; SD = 2.39). The ADHD + SLD group performed worse than the control group in the WISC-V indices WMI, PSI, FSIQ, AWMI, CPI and worse than the SLD group in these indices and the VCI, NVI and GAI. Therefore, compared to children with SLD, children with ADHD + SLD did not show specific impairments in any particular cognitive domain but rather non-specific impairment in almost all indices. Hence, the WISC-V is suited to depict the cognitive strength and weaknesses of an individual child as a basis for targeted intervention.},

The Ignore group was instructed to “try not to let the clicks disturb your relaxed state.” Separate ANOVAs with repeated measures were used to evaluate all measures, and all showed significant effects for click repetition (habituation). Alpha suppression and change in log conductance showed no differences related to group. The P300 component of the average evoked potentials was significantly larger for the Attend group. We concluded that attending to, versus ignoring, stimuli does not have an appreciable effect on these two traditional measures of the orienting response, but it does affect the evoked potentials.

Method: A literature review of the Vietnam Veteran Study in relation to drug consumption. Results: The soldiers greatly increased their consumption of heroin in Vietnam, but almost all of them ceased using it upon returning home. The analysis of the environmental factors related to this self-healing is a critique of the brain disease model of addictions because it cannot explain this or other studies. Conclusion: The biopsychosocial model is still the best model to guide the field of addiction due to its utility, coherence, and efficacy in treatment.},

Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models’ capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

This suggests that estimated capacity could be increased by instructions that encourage more effective encoding strategies. The present study tested this by giving different participants explicit strategy instructions in a change detection task. Compared to a condition in which participants were simply told to do their best, we found that estimated capacity was increased for participants who were instructed to remember the entire visual display, even at set sizes beyond their capacity. However, no increase in estimated capacity was found for a group that was told to focus on a subset of the items in supracapacity arrays. This finding confirms the hypothesis that encoding strategies may influence visual working memory performance, and it is contrary to the hypothesis that the optimal strategy is to filter out any items beyond the storage capacity.},

  abstract = {We compared the effect of locking the event-related potentials (ERPs) on the stimulus vs. the response in a simple (SRT) and in a discriminative (DRT, equally probable Go/No-go) visuo-motor task. The accurate alignment of stimulus- and response-locked ERPs on the same time scale was obtained selecting a group of 27 participants with low inter-individual response time (RT) variation in the two tasks to reduce the jitter of RTs. Two-second epochs were defined for the analyses based on averaged RTs in the two tasks. Results show that the preparatory pre-stimulus activities (i.e., the pN and the BP components) were not affected by the different locking in both SRT and DRT. As expected, the exogenous post-stimulus P1 and N1 components (and the P2, present only in SRT) were larger in stimulus- than response-locked averaging; the same trend was observed for the less-known prefrontal N1 and P1 components (pN1 and pP1) that were larger in stimulus-locked averaging (the effect was not significant in SRT). The prefrontal pP2 component was only present in DRT peaking around 370 ms, and did not show an effect of locking. The frontal-central N2 component was enhanced by response-locked averaging in SRT, while it did not show effects of locking in DRT. The P3 component peaked at about 350 ms over central sites in SRT, and at about 500 ms over parietal sites in DRT; in both cases its amplitude was larger in response- than in stimulus-locked averaging. Overall, the amplitude of the preparatory components was independent from locking, the exogenous components were enhanced by stimulus locking, and the late components were more related to the response than to the stimulus. Concluding, to investigate action preparation, perception, and perceptual-decisional activity ERP studies should adopt stimulus-locked averaging with an appropriate baseline and longer pre-stimulus interval, or use both types of locking.},

  abstract = {Deficits in general emotion regulation skills have been shown to be associated with various mental disorders. Thus, general affect-regulation training has been proposed as promising transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of psychopathology. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a general affect-regulation as a stand-alone, group-based treatment for depression. For this purpose, we randomly assigned 218 individuals who met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) to the Affect Regulation Training (ART), to a waitlist control condition (WLC), or to a condition controlling for common factors (CFC). The primary outcome was the course of depressive symptom severity as assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory. Multi-level analyses indicated that participation in ART was associated with a greater reduction of depressive symptom severity than was participation in WLC (d = 0.56), whereas the slight superiority of ART over CFC (d = 0.25) was not statistically significant. Mediation analyses indicated that changes in emotion regulation skills mediated the differences between ART/CFC and WLC. Thus, the findings provide evidence for enhancing emotion regulation skills as a common mechanism of change in psychological treatments for depression. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01330485) and was supported by grants from the German Research Association (DFG; BE 4510/3-1; HI 456/6-2). Future research should compare the (cost-) efficacy of ART with that of disorder-specific interventions.},

  abstract = {Objectives Deficits in emotion regulation (ER) have been shown to be associated with binge-eating disorder (BED). To further clarify the causal nature of this association, we tested whether systematically enhancing ER skills would reduce symptoms of BED. Methods We randomly allocated N = 101 individuals meeting the criteria for BED to a transdiagnostic ER skills training or to a waitlist control condition (WLC). Primary outcome was the reduction in binges during the treatment-vs.-waiting period as assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview. Results Mixed-model ANOVAs indicated that the average pre-to-post decrease in binges assessed with the EDE was significantly greater in the ER skills training condition than in the WLC (d = 0.66). These effects were stable over the 6-month follow-up period (d = 0.72). Remission rates at post/follow-up were 34.4/45.0\% in the skills training and 7.5/20.0\% in the WLC. Additionally, we found a greater reduction in general eating disorder psychopathology, of food consumption in a bogus taste test and of depression in the ER skills training condition. Moreover, the greater reduction in binge-eating episodes in the training condition was (partially) mediated by a greater increase in ER skills. Conclusions The findings provide further support for the assumed importance of deficits in ER as a maintaining factor and, hence, as a target in the treatment of BED. As ER skills trainings have been shown to also reduce other kinds of psychopathology, they might be considered a promising transdiagnostic add-on component to disorder-specific interventions.},

Unlike most reviews of EF, which focus on preschoolers, this review focuses on studies that include large age ranges. It outlines the development of the foundational components of EF—inhibition, working memory, and shifting. Cognitive and neurophysiological assessments show that although EF emerges during the first few years of life, it continues to strengthen significantly throughout childhood and adolescence. The components vary somewhat in their developmental trajectories. The article relates the findings to long-standing issues of development (e.g., developmental sequences, trajectories, and processes) and suggests research needed for constructing a developmental framework encompassing early childhood through adolescence.},

  abstract = {The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.},

  abstract = {Modern nosologies (e.g., International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition [ICD-11], Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition [DSM–5]) for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and dependence prioritize reliability and clinical presentation over etiology, resulting in a diagnosis that is not always strongly grounded in basic theory and research. Within these nosologies, DSM–5 AUD is treated as a discrete, largely categorical, but graded, phenomenon, which results in additional challenges (e.g., significant phenotypic heterogeneity). Efforts to increase the compatibility between AUD diagnosis and modern conceptualizations of alcohol dependence, which describe it as dimensional and partially overlapping with other psychopathology (e.g., other substance use disorders), will inspire a stronger scientific framework and strengthen AUD’s validity. We conducted a systematic review of 144 reviews to integrate addiction constructs and theories into a comprehensive framework to identify fundamental mechanisms implicated in AUD. The product of this effort was the Etiologic, Theory-based, Ontogenetic Hierarchical Framework (ETOH Framework) of AUD mechanisms, which outlines superdomains of cognitive control, reward, and negative valence and emotionality, each of which subsume narrower, hierarchically organized components. We also outline opponent processes and self-awareness as key moderators of AUD mechanisms. In contrast with other frameworks, we recommend an increased conceptual role for negative valence and compulsion in AUD. The ETOH framework serves as a critical step toward conceptualizations of AUD as dimensional and heterogeneous. It has the potential to improve AUD assessment and aid in the development of evidence-based diagnostic measures that focus on key mechanisms in AUD, consequently facilitating precision medicine.

  abstract = {Precision medicine has been advanced as a potential solution to the problem of alcohol use disorder heterogeneity and modest alcohol use disorder treatment efficacy. The success of precision medicine lies in our ability to first identify the etiologic and maintenance mechanisms at play for a given person and then choose the treatment that is most likely to address such mechanisms. There exist several frameworks that describe empirically supported substance use disorder (SUD) etiologic and maintenance mechanisms (e.g., the Etiologic, Theory-based, Ontogenetic, Hierarchical [ETOH] Framework). There also exists a large literature on mechanisms of behavior change in alcohol use disorder treatment. However, the mechanism of behavior change literature on alcohol use disorder treatments has focused broadly on mechanisms of change rather than more specifically on core alcohol use disorder etiologic and maintenance mechanisms. Thus, the two types of mechanisms have never been integrated or systematically evaluated for their overlap. As such, the aim of the present brief review is to demonstrate how commonly used alcohol use disorder treatments may overlap with and directly target certain alcohol use disorder etiologic and maintenance mechanisms (specifically those described by the ETOH framework). We delineate empirically plausible overlapping mechanisms and theoretically plausible overlapping mechanisms that warrant more research. Last, based on the identification of empirically and theoretically plausible overlapping mechanisms, we elaborate on how ongoing work related to alcohol use disorder precision medicine may test specific hypotheses regarding which treatments work best for whom.

  abstract = {In the past decades, reductionism has dominated both research directions and funding policies in clinical psychology and psychiatry. The intense search for the biological basis of mental disorders, however, has not resulted in conclusive reductionist explanations of psychopathology. Recently, network models have been proposed as an alternative framework for the analysis of mental disorders, in which mental disorders arise from the causal interplay between symptoms. In this target article, we show that this conceptualization can help explain why reductionist approaches in psychiatry and clinical psychology are on the wrong track. First, symptom networks preclude the identification of a common cause of symptomatology with a neurobiological condition; in symptom networks, there is no such common cause. Second, symptom network relations depend on the content of mental states and, as such, feature intentionality. Third, the strength of network relations is highly likely to depend partially on cultural and historical contexts as well as external mechanisms in the environment. Taken together, these properties suggest that, if mental disorders are indeed networks of causally related symptoms, reductionist accounts cannot achieve the level of success associated with reductionist disease models in modern medicine. As an alternative strategy, we propose to interpret network structures in terms of D. C. Dennett’s (1987) notion of real patterns, and suggest that, instead of being reducible to a biological basis, mental disorders feature biological and psychological factors that are deeply intertwined in feedback loops. This suggests that neither psychological nor biological levels can claim causal or explanatory priority, and that a holistic research strategy is necessary for progress in the study of mental disorders.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

  abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable debate and concern as to whether there is a replication crisis in the scientific literature. A likely cause of poor replication is the multiple comparisons problem. An important way in which this problem can manifest in the M/EEG context is through post hoc tailoring of analysis windows (a.k.a. regions-of-interest, ROIs) to landmarks in the collected data. Post hoc tailoring of ROIs is used because it allows researchers to adapt to inter-experiment variability and discover novel differences that fall outside of windows defined by prior precedent, thereby reducing Type II errors. However, this approach can dramatically inflate Type I error rates. One way to avoid this problem is to tailor windows according to a contrast that is orthogonal (strictly parametrically orthogonal) to the contrast being tested. A key approach of this kind is to identify windows on a fully flattened average. On the basis of simulations, this approach has been argued to be safe for post hoc tailoring of analysis windows under many conditions. Here, we present further simulations and mathematical proofs to show exactly why the Fully Flattened Average approach is unbiased, providing a formal grounding to the approach, clarifying the limits of its applicability and resolving published misconceptions about the method. We also provide a statistical power analysis, which shows that, in specific contexts, the fully flattened average approach provides higher statistical power than Fieldtrip cluster inference. This suggests that the Fully Flattened Average approach will enable researchers to identify more effects from their data without incurring an inflation of the false positive rate.},

  abstract = {The information that individuals can hold in working memory is quite limited, but researchers have typically studied this capacity using simple objects or letter strings with no associations between them. However, in the real world there are strong associations and regularities in the input. In an information theoretic sense, regularities introduce redundancies that make the input more compressible. The current study shows that observers can take advantage of these redundancies, enabling them to remember more items in working memory. In 2 experiments, covariance was introduced between colors in a display so that over trials some color pairs were more likely to appear than other color pairs. Observers remembered more items from these displays than from displays where the colors were paired randomly. The improved memory performance cannot be explained by simply guessing the high-probability color pair, suggesting that observers formed more efficient representations to remember more items. Further, as observers learned the regularities, their working memory performance improved in a way that is quantitatively predicted by a Bayesian learning model and optimal encoding scheme. These results suggest that the underlying capacity of the individuals’ working memory is unchanged, but the information they have to remember can be encoded in a more compressed fashion.

Online social networks have become a ubiquitous medium for discussing moral and political ideas. Nevertheless, the field of moral psychology has yet to investigate why some moral and political ideas spread more widely than others. Using a large sample of social media communications concerning polarizing issues in public policy debates (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change), we found that the presence of moral-emotional language in political messages substantially increases their diffusion within (and less so between) ideological group boundaries. These findings offer insights into how moral ideas spread within networks during real political discussion.           ,                             Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (               n               = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20\% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.},

Nowhere is this connection more obvious than in research that attempts to measure the capacity of visual memory. We will review research on the capacity of visual working memory and visual long-term memory, highlighting recent work that emphasizes the contents of memory.

  abstract = {Relationships between neuroimaging measures and behavior provide important clues about brain function and cognition in healthy and clinical populations. While electroencephalography (EEG) provides a portable, low cost measure of brain dynamics, it has been somewhat underrepresented in the emerging field of model-based inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior, with an emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing on peaks or “components” derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects (generating the event-related potential, ERP). First, we review methods for deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition), filtering based on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source separation, BSS), and generating more abstract representations of data (e.g., using deep learning). We then review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental tasks, including the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among these measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). We think that these methodological tools are likely to contribute to theoretical advancements, and will help inform our understandings of brain dynamics that contribute to moment-to-moment cognitive function.},

  abstract = {One particular weakness of psychology that was left implicit by Meehl is the fact that psychological theories tend to be verbal theories, permitting at best ordinal predictions. Such predictions do not enable the high-risk tests that would strengthen our belief in the verisimilitude of theories but instead lead to the practice of null-hypothesis significance testing, a practice Meehl believed to be a major reason for the slow theoretical progress of soft psychology. The rising popularity of meta-analysis has led some to argue that we should move away from significance testing and focus on the size and stability of effects instead. Proponents of this reform assume that a greater emphasis on quantity can help psychology to develop a cumulative body of knowledge. The crucial question in this endeavor is whether the resulting numbers really have theoretical meaning. Psychological science lacks an undisputed, preexisting domain of observations analogous to the observations in the space-time continuum in physics. It is argued that, for this reason, effect sizes do not really exist independently of the adopted research design that led to their manifestation. Consequently, they can have no bearing on the verisimilitude of a theory.},

  abstract = {There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of research studies employing event-related potential (ERP) techniques to examine dynamic and rapidly-occurring neural processes with children during the preschool and early childhood years. Despite this, there has been little discussion of the methodological and procedural differences that exist for studies of young children versus older children and adults. That is, reviewers, editors, and consumers of this work often expect developmental studies to simply apply adult techniques and procedures to younger samples. Procedurally, this creates unrealistic expectations for research paradigms, data collection, and data reduction and analyses. Scientifically, this leads to inappropriate measures and methods that hinder drawing conclusions and advancing theory. Based on ERP work with preschoolers and young children from 10 laboratories across North America, we present a summary of the most common ERP components under study in the area of emotion and cognition in young children along with 13 realistic expectations for data collection and loss, laboratory procedures and paradigms, data processing, ERP averaging, and typical challenges for conducting this type of work. This work is intended to supplement previous guidelines for work with adults and offer insights to aid researchers, reviewers, and editors in the design and evaluation of developmental research using ERPs. Here we make recommendations for researchers who plan to conduct or who are conducting ERP studies in children between ages 2 and 12, focusing on studies of toddlers and preschoolers. Recommendations are based on both data and our cumulative experience and include guidelines for laboratory setup, equipment and recording settings, task design, and data processing.},

  abstract = {In ERP and other large multidimensional neuroscience data sets, researchers often select regions of interest (ROIs) for analysis. The method of ROI selection can critically affect the conclusions of a study by causing the researcher to miss effects in the data or to detect spurious effects. In practice, to avoid inflating Type I error rate (i.e., false positives), ROIs are often based on a priori hypotheses or independent information. However, this can be insensitive to experiment-specific variations in effect location (e.g., latency shifts) reducing power to detect effects. Data-driven ROI selection, in contrast, is nonindependent and uses the data under analysis to determine ROI positions. Therefore, it has potential to select ROIs based on experiment-specific information and increase power for detecting effects. However, data-driven methods have been criticized because they can substantially inflate Type I error rate. Here, we demonstrate, using simulations of simple ERP experiments, that data-driven ROI selection can indeed be more powerful than a priori hypotheses or independent information. Furthermore, we show that data-driven ROI selection using the aggregate grand average from trials (AGAT), despite being based on the data at hand, can be safely used for ROI selection under many circumstances. However, when there is a noise difference between conditions, using the AGAT can inflate Type I error and should be avoided. We identify critical assumptions for use of the AGAT and provide a basis for researchers to use, and reviewers to assess, data-driven methods of ROI localization in ERP and other studies.},

  abstract = {Common outputs of software programs for network estimation include association matrices containing the edge weights between pairs of symptoms and a plot of the symptom network. Although such outputs are useful, it is sometimes difficult to ascertain structural relationships among symptoms from these types of output alone. We propose that matrix permutation provides a simple, yet effective, approach for clarifying the order relationships among the symptoms based on the edge weights of the network. For directed symptom networks, we use a permutation criterion that has classic applications in electrical circuit theory and economics. This criterion can be used to place symptoms that strongly predict other symptoms at the beginning of the ordering, and symptoms that are strongly predicted by other symptoms at the end. For undirected symptom networks, we recommend a permutation criterion that is based on location theory in the field of operations research. When using this criterion, symptoms with many strong ties tend to be placed centrally in the ordering, whereas weakly-tied symptoms are placed at the ends. The permutation optimization problems are solved using dynamic programming. We also make use of branch-search algorithms for extracting maximum cardinality subsets of symptoms that have perfect structure with respect to a selected criterion. Software for implementing the dynamic programming algorithms is available in MATLAB and R. Two networks from the literature are used to demonstrate the matrix permutation algorithms.},

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is widely used as a screener for detecting mental health difficulties in these populations, but its use thus far has been restricted to groups of children with diagnosed disorders (e.g., ADHD). Transdiagnostic approaches, which focus on symptoms and soften or remove the boundaries between traditional categorical disorders, are increasingly adopted in research and practice. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of the SDQ to detect concurrent mental health problems in a transdiagnostic sample of children. The sample were referred by health and educational professionals for difficulties related to learning (N = 389). Some had one diagnosis, others had multiple, but many had no diagnoses. Parent-rated SDQ scores were significantly positively correlated with parent ratings of mental health difficulties on the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). Ratings on the SDQ Emotion subscale significantly predicted the likelihood of having concurrent clinical anxiety and depression scores. Ratings on the Hyperactivity subscale predicted concurrent anxiety levels. These findings suggest the SDQ could be a valuable screening tool for identifying existing mental health difficulties in children recognized as struggling, as it can be in typically developing children and those with specific diagnoses.},

Furthermore, regression analyses revealed that each executive function measure predicted unique variance in mathematics ability. These results are discussed in terms of a central executive with diverse functions (Shallice \& Burgess, 1996) and with recent evidence from Miyake, et al. (2000) showing the unity and diversity among executive functions. It is proposed that the particular difficulties for children of lower mathematical ability are lack of inhibition and poor working memory, which result in problems with switching and evaluation of new strategies for dealing with a particular task. The practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed, along with suggestions for task changes and longitudinal studies that would clarify theoretical and developmental issues related to executive functioning.},

Children were tested in preschool (M age = 4 years, 6 months) on a battery of cognitive measures, and mathematics and reading outcomes (from standardized, norm-referenced school-based assessments) were taken on entry to primary school, and at the end of the first and third year of primary school. Growth curve analyses examined predictors of math and reading achievement across the duration of the study and revealed that better digit span and executive function skills provided children with an immediate head start in math and reading that they maintained throughout the first three years of primary school. Visual-spatial short-term memory span was found to be a predictor specifically of math ability. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that visual short-term and working memory were found to specifically predict math achievement at each time point, while executive function skills predicted learning in general rather than learning in one specific domain. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to further understanding the role of cognitive skills in different mathematical tasks, and in relation to the impact of limited cognitive skills in the classroom environment.},

  abstract = {The interaction between short- and long-term memory is studied within a model in which phonemic and (temporal) contextual information have separate influences on immediate verbal serial recall via connections with short- and long-term plasticity [Burgess, N., \& Hitch, G.J. (1999). Memory for serial order: a network model of the phonological loop and its timing. Psychological Review, 106, 551–581]. Long-term learning of sequences of familiar items is correctly predicted to interact with temporal grouping but not phonological similarity or articulatory suppression. However the model fails to predict learning of different sequences simultaneously, or of partially repeated lists. In a revised model, sufficiently different sequences recruit different context signals while sufficiently similar sequences recruit the same signal, via a cumulative matching process during encoding. Simulations show this revised model captures the experimental data on Hebb repetition, including the importance of matching at the start of a list, makes novel predictions concerning the effects of partial repetition, and provides a potential mechanism for position specific intrusions and the build up of proactive interference.},

  abstract = {It is well established that measures of reasoning ability and of working memory capacity (WMC) correlate positively. However, the question of what explains this relationship remains open. The purpose of this study was to investigate the capacity hypothesis, which ascribes causality to WMC. This hypothesis holds that people high in WMC are more successful in capacity-demanding cognitive tasks than people lower in WMC because they can temporarily maintain more information in the form of sub-goals, hypotheses, and partial solutions. Accordingly, this hypothesis predicts that the correlation between WMC and reasoning performance should increase as the capacity demands of the reasoning items increase. We tested this prediction using items from Raven’s Progressive Matrices and two measures of WMC, complex span and the k estimate from the Visual Arrays task. Neither WMC measure showed the effect predicted by the capacity hypothesis. Furthermore, the results cannot be attributed to restriction of range in performance on the individual reasoning items. This finding adds to existing evidence calling into question the capacity hypothesis, and, more generally, the view that WMC has a causal influence on fluid intelligence.},

  abstract = {There is consensus that activation within distributed functional brain networks underlies human thought. The impact of this consensus is limited, however, by a gap that exists between data-driven correlational analyses that specify where functional brain activity is localized using fMRI, and neural process accounts that specify how neural activity unfolds through time to give rise to behavior. Here, we show how an integrative cognitive neuroscience approach may bridge this gap. In an exemplary study of visual working memory, we use multi-level Bayesian statistics to demonstrate that a neural dynamic model simultaneously explains behavioral data and predicts localized patterns of brain activity, outperforming standard analytic approaches to fMRI. The model explains performance on both correct trials and incorrect trials where errors in change detection emerge from neural fluctuations amplified by neural interaction. Critically, predictions of the model run counter to cognitive theories of the origin of errors in change detection. Results reveal neural patterns predicted by the model within regions of the dorsal attention network that have been the focus of much debate. The model-based analysis suggests that key areas in the dorsal attention network such as the intraparietal sulcus play a central role in change detection rather than working memory maintenance, counter to previous interpretations of fMRI studies. More generally, the integrative cognitive neuroscience approach used here establishes a framework for directly testing theories of cognitive and brain function using the combined power of behavioral and fMRI data.},

  abstract = {Objectives To examine the association between intelligence measured in childhood and leading causes of death in men and women over the life course. Design Prospective cohort study based on a whole population of participants born in Scotland in 1936 and linked to mortality data across 68 years of follow-up. Setting Scotland. Participants 33 536 men and 32 229 women who were participants in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 (SMS1947) and who could be linked to cause of death data up to December 2015. Main outcome measures Cause specific mortality, including from coronary heart disease, stroke, specific cancer types, respiratory disease, digestive disease, external causes, and dementia. Results Childhood intelligence was inversely associated with all major causes of death. The age and sex adjusted hazard ratios (and 95\% confidence intervals) per 1 SD (about 15 points) advantage in intelligence test score were strongest for respiratory disease (0.72, 0.70 to 0.74), coronary heart disease (0.75, 0.73 to 0.77), and stroke (0.76, 0.73 to 0.79). Other notable associations (all P{$<$}0.001) were observed for deaths from injury (0.81, 0.75 to 0.86), smoking related cancers (0.82, 0.80 to 0.84), digestive disease (0.82, 0.79 to 0.86), and dementia (0.84, 0.78 to 0.90). Weak associations were apparent for suicide (0.87, 0.74 to 1.02) and deaths from cancer not related to smoking (0.96, 0.93 to 1.00), and their confidence intervals included unity. There was a suggestion that childhood intelligence was somewhat more strongly related to coronary heart disease, smoking related cancers, respiratory disease, and dementia in women than men (P value for interactions {$<$}0.001, 0.02, {$<$}0.001, and 0.02, respectively).Childhood intelligence was related to selected cancer presentations, including lung (0.75, 0.72 to 0.77), stomach (0.77, 0.69 to 0.85), bladder (0.81, 0.71 to 0.91), oesophageal (0.85, 0.78 to 0.94), liver (0.85, 0.74 to 0.97), colorectal (0.89, 0.83 to 0.95), and haematopoietic (0.91, 0.83 to 0.98). Sensitivity analyses on a representative subsample of the cohort observed only small attenuation of the estimated effect of intelligence (by 10-26\%) after adjustment for potential confounders, including three indicators of childhood socioeconomic status. In a replication sample from Scotland, in a similar birth year cohort and follow-up period, smoking and adult socioeconomic status partially attenuated (by 16-58\%) the association of intelligence with outcome rates. Conclusions In a whole national population year of birth cohort followed over the life course from age 11 to age 79, higher scores on a well validated childhood intelligence test were associated with lower risk of mortality ascribed to coronary heart disease and stroke, cancers related to smoking (particularly lung and stomach), respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, injury, and dementia.},

  abstract = {Relapse prevention remains a major challenge in psychiatry, thus indicating that the established treatment methods combining psychotherapy with neuropharmacological interventions are not entirely effective. In recent years, several intervention strategies have been devised that are aimed at improving psychiatric treatment by providing a complementary set of add-on tools that can be used by clinicians to improve current patient assessment. Among these, cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) have been indexed as valuable biomarkers of the pathophysiological mechanisms of various mental illnesses. However, despite decades of research, their clinical utility is still controversial and a matter of debate. In this opinion review, I present the main arguments supporting the use of cognitive ERPs in the management of psychiatric disorders, stressing why it is currently still not the case despite the vast number of ERP studies to date. I also propose a clinically-oriented suitable way in which this technique could — in my opinion — be effectively incorporated into individual patient care by promotion of the use of individual ERP test-retest sessions and the use of a multi-component approach.},

  abstract = {Alcohol dependence is currently one of the most serious public health problems. Indeed, 3–8\% of all deaths worldwide are attributable to effects of alcohol consumption. Although the first step in alcohol dependence treatment is straightforward, the main problem for clinicians lies with the prevention of relapse, as 40–70\% of patients who only undergo psychosocial therapy resume alcohol use within a year following treatment. This review of the literature regarding event-related potentials (ERPs) is focused on two major neurocognitive factors that partially account for the inability of many alcoholics to remain abstinent: attentional biases towards alcohol-related stimuli that increase the urge to drink, and impaired response inhibition towards these cues that makes it more difficult for alcoholics to resist the temptation to drink. On this basis, we propose new research avenues to better implement ERPs in the management of alcohol disorders, according to four main directions that relate to (1) the development of ERP serial recordings; (2) the promotion of a multi-component ERP approach; (3) the definition of multi-site guidelines; and (4) the use of more representative laboratory situations through the use of more compelling environments.},

Aims: To investigate alcohol use trajectories in the NYC metropolitan area in the 3 years after 11 September and examine the relative contributions of acute exposure to the attacks and ongoing stressors to these trajectories. Design: We used a population-based cohort of adults recruited through a random-digit-dial telephone survey in 2002; participants completed three follow-up interviews over 30 months. Setting The NYC metropolitan area. Participants: A total of 2752 non-institutionalized adult residents of NYC. Measurements: We used growth mixture models to assess trajectories in levels of total alcohol consumption and bingeing in the past 30 days, and predictors of these trajectories. Findings: We identified five trajectories of alcohol consumption levels and three bingeing trajectories. Predictors of higher levels of use over time included ongoing stressors, traumatic events and lower income. Ongoing exposure to stressors and low income also play a central role in bingeing trajectories. Conclusions: While point-in-time mass traumatic events may matter in the short term, their contribution subsides over time. Accumulated stressors and traumatic events, in contrast, lead to higher levels of consumption among respondents already vulnerable to high alcohol use. Interventions to mitigate post-disaster stressors may have substantial benefit in reducing alcohol abuse in the medium- to long term. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Since the concept of working memory was introduced over 50 years ago, different schools of thought have offered different definitions for working memory based on the various cognitive domains that it encompasses. The general consensus regarding working memory supports the idea that working memory is extensively involved in goal-directed behaviors in which information must be retained and manipulated to ensure successful task execution. Before the emergence of other competing models, the concept of working memory was described by the multicomponent working memory model proposed by Baddeley and Hitch. In the present article, the authors provide an overview of several working memory-relevant studies in order to harmonize the findings of working memory from the neurosciences and psychological standpoints, especially after citing evidence from past studies of healthy, aging, diseased, and/or lesioned brains. In particular, the theoretical framework behind working memory, in which the related domains that are considered to play a part in different frameworks (such as memory’s capacity limit and temporary storage) are presented and discussed. From the neuroscience perspective, it has been established that working memory activates the fronto-parietal brain regions, including the prefrontal, cingulate, and parietal cortices. Recent studies have subsequently implicated the roles of subcortical regions (such as the midbrain and cerebellum) in working memory. Aging also appears to have modulatory effects on working memory; age interactions with emotion, caffeine and hormones appear to affect working memory performances at the neurobiological level. Moreover, working memory deficits are apparent in older individuals, who are susceptible to cognitive deterioration. Another younger population with working memory impairment consists of those with mental, developmental, and/or neurological disorders such as major depressive disorder and others. A less coherent and organized neural pattern has been consistently reported in these disadvantaged groups. Working memory of patients with traumatic brain injury was similarly affected and shown to have unusual neural activity (hyper- or hypoactivation) as a general observation. Decoding the underlying neural mechanisms of working memory helps support the current theoretical understandings concerning working memory, and at the same time provides insights into rehabilitation programs that target working memory impairments from neurophysiological or psychological aspects.},

Aims               To investigate the longitudinal relationships between symptoms in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with psychiatric disorders.                                         Method               A two-wave, cross-lagged panel network model of 15 nodes representing symptoms of depression, (social) anxiety and attenuated psychotic symptoms was estimated, using baseline and 1-year follow-up data of 222 individuals with psychiatric disorders. Centrality indices were calculated to determine important predictors and outcomes.                                         Results               Our results demonstrated that the strongest relationships in the network were between (a) more suicidal ideation predicting more negative self-view, and (b) autoregressive relationships of social anxiety symptoms positively reinforcing themselves. Negative self-view was the most predictable node in the network as it had the highest ‘in-expected influence’ centrality, and may be an important transdiagnostic outcome symptom.                                         Conclusions               The results give insight into longitudinal interactions between symptoms, which interact in ways that do not adhere to broader diagnostic categories. Our results suggest that self-view can also be a transdiagnostic outcome of psychopathology rather than just a predictor, as is normally posited, and may especially have an important relationship with suicidal ideation. Overall, our study demonstrates the dynamic complexity of psychopathology, and further supports the importance of investigating symptom interactions of different psychopathological dimensions over time and across disorders.},

  abstract = {Background. Patients with psychiatric disorders often experience cognitive dysfunction, but the precise relationship between cognitive deficits and psychopathology remains unclear. We investigated the relationships between domains of cognitive functioning and psychopathology in a transdiagnostic sample using a data-driven approach. Methods. Cross-sectional network analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between domains of psychopathology and cognitive functioning and detect clusters in the network. This naturalistic transdiagnostic sample consists of 1016 psychiatric patients who have a variety of psychiatric diagnoses, such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive −compulsive and related disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed using various questionnaires. Core cognitive domains were assessed with a battery of automated tests. Results. Network analysis detected three clusters that we labelled: general psychopathology, substance use, and cognition. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, verbal memory, and visual attention were the most central nodes in the network. Most associations between cognitive functioning and symptoms were negative, i.e. increased symptom severity was associated with worse cognitive functioning. Cannabis use, (subclinical) psychotic experiences, and anhedonia had the strongest total negative relationships with cognitive variables. Conclusions. Cognitive functioning and psychopathology are independent but related dimensions, which interact in a transdiagnostic manner. Depression, anxiety, verbal memory, and visual attention are especially relevant in this network and can be considered independent transdiagnostic targets for research and treatment in psychiatry. Moreover, future research on cognitive functioning in psychopathology should take a transdiagnostic approach, focusing on symptom-specific interactions with cognitive domains rather than investigating cognitive functioning within diagnostic categories.},

  abstract = {Suppressing the neural activities to non-target stimuli becomes problematic with advancing age. Go/Nogo tasks, in which subjects are instructed to respond to a certain type of stimuli (Go) and withhold responses to other types of predefined stimuli (Nogo), have been extensively employed to study the age-related alterations of cognitive inhibition. However, it remains inconclusive whether the N2 and P3 electrophysiological responses to successful inhibition to Nogo stimuli are affected by aging processes. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of Go/Nogo studies to investigate the age effect on Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 activities as well as behavioral performance of commission errors. The potential moderators regarding different probabilities of Nogo trials and levels of task difficulty on the effect sizes were also assessed. There were no significant age-related differences in commission errors. However, compared to the younger group, the elderly demonstrated reduced Nogo-N2 amplitudes, particularly in the condition where Nogo probability was less than 50\%. Furthermore, age-related reduction of Nogo-P3 amplitudes and prolongation of Nogo-P3 latencies were observed in the condition where Nogo probability was less than 50\%. In conclusion, our data suggest that despite similar behavioral performance in the younger and older adults, neural processing of response inhibition becomes inefficient with advancing age.},

  abstract = {While inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis is a powerful tool for naturalistic scanning data, drawing appropriate statistical inferences is difficult due to the daunting task of accounting for the intricate relatedness in data structure as well as handling the multiple testing issue. Although the linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling approach (Chen et~al., 2017a) is capable of capturing the relatedness in the data and incorporating explanatory variables, there are a few challenging issues: 1) it is difficult to assign accurate degrees of freedom for each testing statistic, 2) multiple testing correction is potentially over-penalizing due to model inefficiency, and 3) thresholding necessitates arbitrary dichotomous decisions. Here we propose a Bayesian multilevel (BML) framework for ISC data analysis that integrates all regions of interest into one model. By loosely constraining the regions through a weakly informative prior, BML dissolves multiplicity through conservatively pooling the effect of each region toward the center and improves collective fitting and overall model performance. In addition to potentially achieving a higher inference efficiency, BML improves spatial specificity and easily allows the investigator to adopt a philosophy of full results reporting. A dataset of naturalistic scanning is utilized to illustrate the modeling approach with 268 parcels and to showcase the modeling capability, flexibility and advantages in results reporting. The associated program will be available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.},

  abstract = {Background Aphasia is often accompanied by impairment of non-language cognitive functions. Assessment of cognitive capacity in people with aphasia (PWA) with standard neuropsychological methods may be problematic due to their language difficulties. Numerous experimental studies indicate that P300 may be considered as an index of cognitive capacity in both healthy and clinical samples. Accordingly, the measurement of event-related potentials enables the investigation of behaviourally non-observable mental processes underlying the cognitive functions that are assessed with neuropsychological tests. Aims To investigate in PWA the relationship between P300 parameters and cognitive function efficiency measured with neuropsychological methods. Methods \& Procedures A total of 25 PWA after left-hemispheric stroke participated in the study. Electrophysiological (EEG) signals were recorded during the performance of a visual Go-No Go task. P300 was identified on nine electrodes, which were then pooled in three lines: left (F3, C3, P3), central (Fz, Cz, Pz) and right (F4, C4, P4). The neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functions included mental speed, short-term memory, divided attention, executive functions, auditory language comprehension and expression. Outcomes \& Results P300 latency correlated with indices of several cognitive functions: temporal resolution, psychomotor speed, spatial short-term memory, planning, word and sentence comprehension, as well as verbal fluency. Shorter P300 latencies were accompanied by greater efficiency of the abovementioned functions. In contrast, significant correlations between P300 amplitudes and cognitive measures were fragmentary. Conclusions \& Implications In PWA, P300 latency might be related to cognitive functioning, especially to measures that rely heavily on the speed of information processing. However, P300 seems to be unrelated to more complex cognitive functions. P300 latency may be used as a neurophysiological correlate of cognitive efficiency in PWA and might have potential applications in monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions in this patient group. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject P300 parameters have been reported to be associated with cognitive performance in both healthy individuals and clinical groups (e.g., patients with Alzheimer's disease). Previous studies show that the presence of P300 at the early post-stroke stage may be a predictor of better recovery of comprehension in PWA. What this paper adds to existing knowledge Our results show for the first time that P300 may be used as a neurophysiological correlate of cognitive efficiency in PWA. In our study, P300 latency was associated with several languages and non-language cognitive functions, especially with those whose effectiveness depends mainly on processing speed. In PWA, shorter latency corresponded to more efficient cognitive functioning. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? P300 measurement may be potentially useful in assessing the efficiency of certain cognitive functions in PWA. It may be also used to monitor the recovery process of PWA and to verify the effects of therapeutic interventions.},

What this paper adds to existing knowledge Our results show for the first time that P300 may be used as a neurophysiological correlate of cognitive efficiency in PWA. In our study, P300 latency was associated with several languages and non-language cognitive functions, especially with those whose effectiveness depends mainly on processing speed. In PWA, shorter latency corresponded to more efficient cognitive functioning. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? P300 measurement may be potentially useful in assessing the efficiency of certain cognitive functions in PWA. It may be also used to monitor the recovery process of PWA and to verify the effects of therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Visual working memory and visual attention are intimately related, such that working memory encoding and maintenance reflects actively sustained attention to a limited number of visual objects and events important for ongoing cognition and action. Although attention is typically considered to operate over perceptual input, a recent taxonomy proposes to additionally consider how attention can be directed to internal perceptual representations in the absence of sensory input, as well as other internal memories, choices, and thoughts (Chun, Golomb, \& Turk-Browne, 2011). Such internal attention enables prolonged binding of features into integrated objects, along with enhancement of relevant sensory mechanisms. These processes are all limited in capacity, although different types of working memory and attention, such as spatial vs. object processing, operate independently with separate capacity. Overall, the success of maintenance depends on the ability to inhibit both external (perceptual) and internal (cognitive) distraction. Working memory is the interface by which attentional mechanisms select and actively maintain relevant perceptual information from the external world as internal representations within the mind.},

  abstract = {Working memory is responsible for the short-term storage and online manipulation of information necessary for higher cognitive functions, such as language, planning and problem-solving1,2. Traditionally, working memory has been divided into two types of processes: executive control (governing the encoding manipulation and retrieval of information in working memory) and active maintenance (keeping information available 'online'). It has also been proposed that these two types of processes may be subserved by distinct cortical structures, with the prefrontal cortex housing the executive control processes, and more posterior regions housing the content-specific buffers (for example verbal versus visuospatial) responsible for active maintenance3,4. However, studies in non-human primates suggest that dorsolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex may also be involved in active maintenance5–8. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activation in human subjects during performance of a working memory task. We used the temporal resolution of this technique to examine the dynamics of regional activation, and to show that prefrontal cortex along with parietal cortex appears to play a role in active maintenance.},

This research has, in turn, led to the development of practical applications of cognitive ERPs in patient populations. In particular, recent work has focused on the development of ERP-based assessment measures for the neuropsychological assessment of dyslexia and language impairments secondary to stroke. This review describes the innovative assessment methods program (IAMP), an initiative to utilize ERPs for a neuropsychological assessment of patients who cannot be evaluated by traditional methods. The success of this program has demonstrated that ERPs can be used to reliably evaluate an individual’s reading and speech comprehension abilities, independent of behavioral and speech production impediments. In contrast to traditional neuropsychological assessment, these ERP methods can discern the cognitive strategies used by an individual to perform a task.},

An individual's WM capacity is predictive of performance in higher cognitive abilities.Although traditionally viewed as an immutable aptitude, more recently WM has been shown to improve with training. Importantly, improvement in WM can transfer between trained and non-trained tasks.There are several models for the neural basis of WM. In this Review, we argue that the persistent discharges of prefrontal neurons play the most important part in the maintenance of information in WM.Effects of WM training include increases in the activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, and increases in the strength of connectivity in the prefrontal cortex and between the prefrontal cortex and other areas.Neural changes after training are found in cortical areas that process spatial information in WM and attention, potentially providing a basis for transfer to other cognitive and behavioural tasks that rely on spatial WM and spatially selective attention.},

It is an almost uniquely intangible sensation: we cannot see time in the way that we see color, shape, or even location. So how is time represented in the brain? We explore the neural substrates of metrical representations of time such as duration estimation (explicit timing) or temporal expectation (implicit timing). Basal ganglia (BG), supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex have all been linked to the explicit estimation of duration. However, each region may have a functionally discrete role and will be differentially implicated depending upon task context. Among these, the dorsal striatum of the BG and, more specifically, its ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway seems to be the most crucial of these regions, as shown by converging functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychopharmacological investigations in humans, as well as lesion and pharmacological studies in animals. Moreover, neuronal firing rates in both striatal and interconnected frontal areas vary as a function of duration, suggesting a neurophysiological mechanism for the representation of time in the brain, with the excitatory–inhibitory balance of interactions among distinct subtypes of striatal neuron serving to fine-tune temporal accuracy and precision.},

Subjects counted the number of target events (P=0.12) randomly interposed in sequences of background events (either P=0.88 or P=0.76). In some sequences, slides bearing the letter A were targets and those bearing the letter B were backgrounds; the reverse was true in the other sequences. Also interposed (P=0.12) in these sequences of targets and background were one of two types of non-target events: in some sequences non-targets were slides (termed dims) bearing any one of the letters from C to Z and having one-tenth the luminance of the target and background slides, while in the others, they were slides bearing ‘novel’ patterns, each consisting of a different, quasi-random, unrecognizable color pattern. The scalp amplitude distribution of P3 waves to novels were initially frontal, but, with repeated presentations of novel events, they became parietal. The scalp distributions of P3 waves to targets and dims were both initially parietal and did not change with repeated presentations of target and dim events. P3 amplitudes to targets were unaffected by repeated presentations of target events. However, P3 amplitudes to dims and novels were affected. P3 amplitudes to dims decreased linearly at Fz, Cz and Pz with repetition of dims. P3 amplitudes to novels decreased at Fz and increased at Pz with repetition of novels. An abbreviated analysis of possible effects of sequential event probabilities on P3 amplitudes and latencies to novels, dims and targets was performed and no effects were found. It is suggested that P3 waves may be affected by at least 4 factors: the facility with which events may be categorized by subjects, the importance attached to events (via task instructions, subjective assessments of the contents of events, etc.), a priori category probability, and sequential event structure. Résumé Les potentiels cérébraux liés aux événements en réponse à des événements présentés de façon tachistoscopique ont été enregistrés chez des adultes âgés de 24 à 36 ans. Les sujets comptent le nombre d'événements-cibles (P=0,12) intercalés de façon aléatoire dans des séquences d'événements de fond (soit P=0,88, soit P-0,76). Dans certaines séquences les projections portant la lettre A constituent les cibles et celles portant la lettre B constituent les images de fond; c'est l'inverse pour d'autres séquences. Egalement intercalées (P=0,12) dans ces séquences de cibles et d'images de fond, on présente une ou deux sortes d'événements non-cibles: dans certaines séquences les événements non-cibles sont des projections (appelées dims) portant n'importe quelles des lettres de C à Z et ayant 110 de la luminance des projections cibles et des projections de fond, tandis que dans d'autres séquences ce sont des projections qui portent des patterns ‘nouveaux’, chacun consistant en un pattern coloré différent, quasi-aléatoire, non-reconnaissable. La distribution sur le scalp des amplitudes des ondes P3 à des événements nouveaux est d'abord frontale, mais, avec la répétition des présentations d'évé0ements nouveaux elle devient pariétale. Les distributions sur le scalp des ondes P3 à des cibles et des dims sont toutes deux d'emblée pariétales et ne se modifient pas avec des présentations répétées d'événements cibles et d'événements dims. Les amplitudes P3 à des cibles ne sont pas affectées par des présentations répétées d'événements cibles. Cependant, les amplitudes P3 aux événements dims et nouveaux sont affectées. Les amplitudes P3 aux événements dims diminuent de façon linéaire aux niveaux Fz, Cz et Pz avec la répétition des dims. Les amplitudes P3 à des événements nouveaux diminuent au niveau Fz et augmentent à Cz avec la répétition des événements nouveaux. Une analyse en raccourci des effects possibles des probabilités séquentielles des événements sur les amplitudes et les latences de P3 aux événements nouveaux, dims et cibles a été réalisée et aucun effet n'a été observé. L'auteur suggère que les ondes P3 peuvent être affectées par au moins 4 facteurs: la facilité avec laquelle les événements peuvent être catégorisés par les sujets, l'importance attachée aux événements (au travers d'instructions, de tâches, d'évaluations subjectives des contenus des événements, etc…), à la probabilité a priori de catégorie, et à la structure séquentielle de l'événement.},

  abstract = {In the recent literature there has been considerable confusion about the three types of memory: long-term, short-term, and working memory. This chapter strives to reduce that confusion and makes upto-date assessments of these types of memory. Long- and short-term memory could differ in two fundamental ways, with only short-term memory demonstrating (1) temporal decay and (2) chunk capacity limits. Both properties of short-term memory are still controversial but the current literature is rather encouraging regarding the existence of both decay and capacity limits. Working memory has been conceived and defined in three different, slightly discrepant ways: as short-term memory applied to cognitive tasks, as a multi-component system that holds and manipulates information in short-term memory, and as the use of attention to manage short-term memory. Regardless of the definition, there are some measures of memory in the short term that seem routine and do not correlate well with cognitive aptitudes and other measures (those usually identified with the term ‘‘working memory’’) that seem more attention demanding and do correlate well with these aptitudes. The evidence is evaluated and placed within a theoretical framework depicted in Fig. 1.},

  abstract = {The topic of working memory (WM) is ubiquitous in research on cognitive psychology and on individual differences. According to one definition, it is a small amount of information kept in a temporary state of heightened accessibility; it is used in most types of communication and problem solving. Short-term storage has been defined as the passive (i.e., non-attention-based, nonstrategic) component of WM or, alternatively, as a passive store separate from an attention-based WM. Here I note that much confusion has been created by the use by various investigators of many, subtly different definitions of WM and short-term storage. The definitions are sometimes made explicit and sometimes implied. As I explain, the different definitions may have stemmed from the use of a wide variety of techniques to explore WM, along with differences in theoretical orientation. By delineating nine previously used definitions of WM and explaining how additional ones may emerge from combinations of these nine, I hope to improve scientific discourse on WM. The potential advantages of clarity about definitions of WM and short-term storage are illustrated with respect to several ongoing research controversies.},

Younger and older adults performed a perceptual judgment task at five levels of complexity for periods of 30, 60, and 120 sec. Participants either continued to perform the task for a specified interval (production) or were stopped and then verbally estimated the interval. Older adults gave shorter verbal estimates and longer productions than did younger adults. The methods of verbal estimation and production yielded approximately equal duration judgment ratios once range effects were taken into account. Task complexity had little effect. The major conclusion is that duration judgment ratios decrease from younger to older adults when the intervals are filled with a mental task.},

From this perspective, comorbidity is a (bi)directional relationship between multiple latent variables. We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization in terms of a network approach, where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.},

We focus on the value of conceptual replications, the attempt to test the same theoretical process as an existing study, but that uses methods that vary in some way from the previous study. The tension between the two kinds of replication is a tension of values—exact replications value confidence in operationalizations; their requirement tends to favor the status quo. Conceptual replications value confidence in theory; their use tends to favor rapid progress over ferreting out error. We describe the many ways in which conceptual replications can be superior to direct replications. We further argue that the social system of science is quite robust to these threats and is self-correcting.},

The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing.

The objective of the present paper is therefore to provide a critical update review of research on alexithymia and problematic alcohol use published since 2009. A systematic search was conducted through PsychINFO, Medline, and ProQuest databases to obtain relevant literature published between 2009 and 2016. Studies that involved measures of alexithymia and problematic alcohol use among clinical and non-clinical samples were included. Prevalence rates of alexithymia among Alcohol Dependent (AD) samples were identified between 30 and 49\%, and were therefore much lower than originally reported. The findings of this update review highlight an indirect relationship between alexithymia and alcohol problem severity that is mediated by a number of psychological drinking constructs (e.g., alcohol expectancy, drinking motives, craving and alcohol related intrusive thoughts) and psychological risk factors for the development of alcohol related problems (e.g., mood and emotion dysregulation, attachment, trauma, and cognitive function). In addition, this review provides reasonable evidence to support alexithymia as an independent risk factor for alcohol related problems among clinical samples only. In conclusion, alexithymia is a multifaceted construct that has a complex relationship with various risk factors and psychological drinking constructs. The growing body of research highlights the demand for understanding the interrelationships between alexithymia, psychosocial risk factors, and problematic alcohol use in order to tailor and target therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Evidence suggests that ASD patients have abnormalities in information processing. Event-related potential (ERP) technique can directly record brain neural activity in real time. P300 is a positive ERP component which can measure the neuroelectrophysiological characteristics of human beings and has the potential to discover the pathological mechanism of ASD. However, P300 studies on ASD patients are incongruent and the disparities may be caused by several factors. By searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases, a meta-analysis of P300 component difference between ASD group and typically developed (TD) control group was conducted. Results of amplitude and latency of P3b and P3a from included studies were synthesized. Random effect model was chosen and standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated. Subgroup analysis was used to identify the source of heterogeneity and to test the effect of different experiment factors. A total of 407 ASD patients and 457 TD controls from 32 studies were included in this analysis. Reduced amplitude of P3b was found in ASD group (SMD = −0.505, 95 \% CI −0.873, −0.138) compared with TD group, but no difference of P3b latency, P3a amplitude, or P3a latency was found between groups. Subgroup analysis showed that oddball paradigm elicited attenuated P3b amplitude in Pz electrode among ASD subjects. This meta-analysis suggests ASD patients have abnormalities in P300 component, which may represent for deficits in cognition, attention orientation and working memory processing, particularly in the decision-making processing condition.

Running through these papers are a pair of themes: that explaining the mind requires functional analysis, not subsumption under "psychological laws", and that the propositional attitudes--belief, desire, intention--and their interactions, while real, are not the key to understanding the mind at a fundamental level. Taking these ideas seriously puts considerable strain on standard conceptions of rationality and reasoning, on truth-conditional semantics, and on our interpretation of experimental evidence concerning cognitive development, learning and the evolution of mental traits and processes. The temptation to read the structure of mental states and their interactions off the structure of human language is powerful and seductive, but has created a widening gap between what most philosophers and social scientists take for granted about the mind, and the framework we need to make sense what an accelerating biology and neuroscience are telling us about brains. The challenge for the philosophy of mind is to devise a framework that accommodates these developments. This is the underlying motivation for the papers in this collection},

Parietal old/new effects were reduced by divided attention, but FN400 old/new effects were not. Parietal ERPs (400–800 ms) in experiment 2 increased with confidence in recognizing old items, but not new items.

  abstract = {Despite a longstanding and widespread influence of the diagnostic approach to mental ill health, there is an emerging and growing consensus that such psychiatric nosologies may no longer be fit for purpose in research and clinical practice. In their place, there is gathering support for a 'transdiagnostic' approach that cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries or, more radically, sets them aside altogether, to provide novel insights into how we might understand mental health difficulties. Removing the distinctions between proposed psychiatric taxa at the level of classification opens up new ways of classifying mental health problems, suggests alternative conceptualizations of the processes implicated in mental health, and provides a platform for novel ways of thinking about onset, maintenance, and clinical treatment and recovery from experiences of disabling mental distress. In this Introduction to a Special Section on Transdiagnostic Approaches to Psychopathology, we provide a narrative review of the transdiagnostic literature in order to situate the Special Section articles in context. We begin with a brief history of the diagnostic approach and outline several challenges it currently faces that arguably limit its applicability in current mental health science and practice. We then review several recent transdiagnostic approaches to classification, biopsychosocial processes, and clinical interventions, highlighting promising novel developments. Finally, we present some key challenges facing transdiagnostic science and make suggestions for a way forward. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Aim Emotional dysregulation (ED), defined by deficits in the ability to monitor and modulate the valence, intensity, and expression of emotions, is typically expressed with irritability, tantrums, mood fluctuations, and self-harm in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although ED does not represent a diagnostic feature of ASD, its manifestations are an important contributor to functional impairment and clinical referral. This study aims to examine the relationship between ED and adaptive functioning in preschoolers clinically referred for ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods A sample of 100 children (74\% males, mean age 39.4 ± 12.3 months), consecutively referred to a university clinic for neurodevelopmental disorders, received clinical assessments of psychopathology with the CBCL and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, of ED- with the CBCL-Attention, Anxious/Depressed, and Aggression index (CBCL-AAA), of autism symptom severity with the ADOS-2 Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS), and of global developmental/cognitive delay (GDD) with the WPPSI-IV or other age-appropriate standardized scales. Adaptive functioning was measured with the ABAS-II. Sixty-five children met DSM-5 criteria for ASD. Multivariate regression models were applied to evaluate the relative contribution of ED, ASD severity and GDD to the ABAS-II general (GAC), conceptual (CAD), social (SAD), and practical (PAD) adaptive functioning domains. Results Overall (n = 100), lower adaptive functioning was associated with higher CBCL-AAA (p = 0.003), higher ADOS-CSS (p {$<$} 0.001), and presence of GDD (p = 0.023). In the ASD group (n = 65), worse CAD was predicted by GDD (p = 0.016), and worse SAD and PAD by higher ADOS-CSS (p = 0.032) and ED (p = 0.002). No sex differences were detected in the study variables. Conclusion Together with the severity of global developmental delay and of autism symptoms, ED is a significant contributor to impairment in adaptive functioning among young children with a neurodevelopmental disorder and, in particular, with ASD. ED could represent a specific target for early interventions aimed at enhancing adaptive functioning in early childhood.},

A perfect-reconstruction filterbank is used to split the data into two parts, one noise-free and the other contaminated by line artifact. The artifact-contaminated stream is processed by a spatial filter to project out line components, and added to the noise-free part to obtain clean data. This method is applicable to multichannel data such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or multichannel local field potentials (LFP). I briefly review past methods, pointing out their drawbacks, describe the new method, and evaluate the outcome using synthetic and real data.},

A goal of model-based cognitive neuroscience is to link these variables to brain measurements, which can advance progress in both cognitive and neuroscientific research. However, the details and the philosophical approach for this linking problem can vary greatly. We propose a continuum of approaches that differ in the degree of tight, quantitative, and explicit hypothesizing. We describe this continuum using four points along it, which we dub qualitative structural, qualitative predictive, quantitative predictive, and single model linking approaches. We further illustrate by providing examples from three research fields (decision making, reinforcement learning, and symbolic reasoning) for the different linking approaches.},

Here, we investigated differences in aggressive and antisocial behaviors between healthy controls (n~=~20) and violent mentally disordered offenders (MDOs; n~=~26), and examined associations between aggressive and antisocial behaviors, behavioral inhibitory control, and neurophysiological activity across the whole sample (n~=~46). Event-related potentials were obtained using EEG while participants completed a Go/NoGo response inhibition task, and aggressive and antisocial behaviors were assessed with the Life History of Aggression (LHA) instrument. Using a robust Bayesian linear regression approach, we found that MDOs scored substantially higher than healthy controls on LHA Aggression and Antisocial subscales. Using the whole sample and after adjusting for age, we found that scores on the LHA Aggression and Antisocial subscales were robustly associated with longer NoGo P3 latency, and less robustly with longer NoGo N2 latency. Post-hoc analyzes suggested that healthy controls and MDOs exhibited similar associations. With several limitations in mind, we suggest that prolonged NoGo P3 latency, reflecting decreased neural efficiency during the later stages of conflict monitoring or outcome evaluation, is a potential neurobehavioral correlate of aggressive and antisocial behaviors.},

Yet no widely used method exists for comparing variability in ordered collections of single-trial data epochs across conditions and subjects. New method We have developed a method based on an ERP-image visualization tool in which potential, spectral power, or some other measure at each time point in a set of event-related single-trial data epochs are represented as color coded horizontal lines that are then stacked to form a 2-D colored image. Moving-window smoothing across trial epochs can make otherwise hidden event-related features in the data more perceptible. Stacking trials in different orders, for example ordered by subject reaction time, by context-related information such as inter-stimulus interval, or some other characteristic of the data (e.g., latency-window mean power or phase of some EEG source) can reveal aspects of the multifold complexities of trial-to-trial EEG data variability. Results This study demonstrates new methods for computing and visualizing ‘grand’ ERP-image plots across subjects and for performing robust statistical testing on the resulting images. These methods have been implemented and made freely available in the EEGLAB signal-processing environment that we maintain and distribute.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly prevalent and requires clinical specialists to diagnose. It is known that an individual's viewing behavior, reflected in their eye movements, is directly related to attentional mechanisms and higher-order cognitive processes. We therefore explore whether ADHD can be detected based on recorded eye movements together with information about the video stimulus in a free-viewing task. To this end, we develop an end-to-end deep learning-based sequence model which we pre-train on a related task for which more data are available. We find that the method is in fact able to detect ADHD and outperforms relevant baselines. We investigate the relevance of the input features in an ablation study. Interestingly, we find that the model's performance is closely related to the content of the video, which provides insights for future experimental designs.},

  abstract = {The current paper highlights a new, interactive Shiny App that can be used to aid in understanding and teaching the important task of conducting a prior sensitivity analysis when implementing Bayesian estimation methods. In this paper, we discuss the importance of examining prior distributions through a sensitivity analysis. We argue that conducting a prior sensitivity analysis is equally important when so-called diffuse priors are implemented as it is with subjective priors. As a proof of concept, we conducted a small simulation study, which illustrates the impact of priors on final model estimates. The findings from the simulation study highlight the importance of conducting a sensitivity analysis of priors. This concept is further extended through an interactive Shiny App that we developed. The Shiny App allows users to explore the impact of various forms of priors using empirical data. We introduce this Shiny App and thoroughly detail an example using a simple multiple regression model that users at all levels can understand. In this paper, we highlight how to determine the different settings for a prior sensitivity analysis, how to visually and statistically compare results obtained in the sensitivity analysis, and how to display findings and write up disparate results obtained across the sensitivity analysis. The goal is that novice users can follow the process outlined here and work within the interactive Shiny App to gain a deeper understanding of the role of prior distributions and the importance of a sensitivity analysis when implementing Bayesian methods. The intended audience is broad (e.g., undergraduate or graduate students, faculty, and other researchers) and can include those with limited exposure to Bayesian methods or the specific model presented here.},

In doing so, it hopes to provide readers with an understanding of the relevance of mathematically grounded approaches to cognitive investigations into linguistic complexity, and thus further fruitful collaborations between cognitive scientists and mathematically inclined linguist and psychologist.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, researchers have used various methodologies to assess different forms of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and their influence on alcohol consumption. Contrasting results between clinical and general populations were observed. To summarize the current literature on RNT and alcohol use, a systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009). Among the 27 included studies, the seven conducted among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and the three focusing on other adult samples demonstrated a strong positive association between RNT and alcohol use or alcohol-related problems, regardless of the form of RNT. The results were more heterogeneous in the 17 studies conducted among adolescents and students, leading the authors to conclude that the results varied as a function of the severity of alcohol use. The results of this study suggest to focus on RNT from a transdiagnostic perspective in AUD. This processual approach may improve AUD treatment and relapse prevention. Finally, some gaps in the literature must be addressed: (1) the gender differences in the link between RNT and alcohol use and (2) the specific influence of RNT on alcohol use among young adults.},

While generic treatments of ANOVA methodology are available, ERP datasets have many unique characteristics that must be considered. In the present report, a novelty oddball dataset was utilized as a test case to determine whether three aspects of ANOVA procedures as applied to ERPs make a real-world difference: the effects of reference site, regional channels, and robust ANOVAs. Recommendations are provided for best practices in each of these areas.},

The first study illustrates that the methods will often agree, both in motivating researchers to conclude that H1 is supported better than H0, and the other way round, that H0 is better supported than H1. The next four, however, show that the methods will also often disagree. In these cases, the aim of the paper will be to motivate the sensible evidential conclusion, and then see which approach matches those intuitions. Specifically, it is shown that a high-powered non-significant result is consistent with no evidence for H0 over H1 worth mentioning, which a Bayes factor can show, and, conversely, that a low-powered non-significant result is consistent with substantial evidence for H0 over H1, again indicated by Bayesian analyses. The fourth study illustrates that a high-powered significant result may not amount to any evidence for H1 over H0, matching the Bayesian conclusion. Finally, the fifth study illustrates that different theories can be evidentially supported to different degrees by the same data; a fact that P-values cannot reflect but Bayes factors can. It is argued that appropriate conclusions match the Bayesian inferences, but not those based on significance testing, where they disagree.},

  abstract = {Background The P300 component of the event-related potential is a large positive waveform that can be extracted from the ongoing electroencephalogram using a two-stimuli oddball paradigm, and has been associated with cognitive information processing (e.g. memory, attention, executive function). This paper reviews the development of the auditory P300 across the lifespan. Methodology/Principal Findings A systematic review and meta-analysis on the P300 was performed including 75 studies (n = 2,811). Scopus was searched for studies using healthy subjects and that reported means of P300 latency and amplitude measured at Pz and mean age. These findings were validated in an independent, existing cross-sectional dataset including 1,572 participants from ages 6–87. Curve-fitting procedures were applied to obtain a model of P300 development across the lifespan. In both studies logarithmic Gaussian models fitted the latency and amplitude data best. The P300 latency and amplitude follow a maturational path from childhood to adolescence, resulting in a period that marks a plateau, after which degenerative effects begin. We were able to determine ages that mark a maximum (in P300 amplitude) or trough (in P300 latency) segregating maturational from degenerative stages. We found these points of deflection occurred at different ages. Conclusions/Significance It is hypothesized that latency and amplitude index different aspects of brain maturation. The P300 latency possibly indexes neural speed or brain efficiency. The P300 amplitude might index neural power or cognitive resources, which increase with maturation.},

  abstract = {An attempt was made to determine the effects of attention on average evoked potentials when no general change in the alertness of the subject and when no peripheral gating of sensory inputs can be assumed to operate. Human subjects viewed a 50 msec flash of light superimposed on a fluctuating background (e.g., a circle alternating aperiodically with a square). In one of the two experimental conditions, the subject was instructed to ignore the background alternations and to respond to the flash; in the other condition, the subject was required to ignore the flash and to respond to the fluctuations in the background. It was found that the stimulus to which the subject had to respond elicited an AEP with a considerably enhanced late positive component (latency to peak 250–300 msec). Résumé Les auteurs tentent de déterminer les effets de l'attention sur les potentiels évoqués moyens lorsque ne peuvent être incriminés ni une variation générale de la vigilance du sujet, ni une condition périphérique d'envoi des stimuli sensoriels. Des sujets humains regardent un éclair lumineux de 50 msec surimposé à un fond fluctuant (par exemple, un cercle qui alterne avec un carré de manière apériodique). Dans l'une des deux conditions expérimentales on demande au sujet d'ignorer les fluctuations du fond et de répondre à l'éclair; dans l'autre condition on lui demande d'ignorer l'éclair et de répondre aux fluctuations du fond. Les auteurs observent que le stimulus auquel le sujet doit répondre détermine un potentiel évoqué moyen caractérisé par une augmentation considérable de la composante positive tardive (latence du pic 250–300 msec).},

  abstract = {The nature of the psychophysiological enterprise is examined as it bears on the study of the endogenous components of event-related brain potentials (ERP). The view is taken that success in Psychophysiology should be measured by the degree to which psychophysiological data can be used in elucidating the processes that underly the behavioral product rather than by the enumeration of psychophysiological “correlates” of behavior. It is proposed that endogenous ERP components are best viewed as manifestations of the activities of “subroutines” invoked during the informational transactions of the brain. A theoretical account of an ERP component consists of the specification of the functional role of the subroutine it manifests. Studies of the P300 components are examined for the contribution they make to the development of such a theory of the P300. Experiments focusing on P300 latency and amplitude are reviewed and it is concluded that P300 may be a manifestation of the processes whereby schemas are revised. The relationship between P300 and the Orienting Reflex is discussed within the framework of this model. It is suggested that P300 amplitude may predict the memorability of events. A preliminary test of this prediction is described.},

Method: The sample consisted of 358 children and teenagers aged 6 to 17 years of both sexes with (n = 190) and without a diagnosis of ADHD (n = 168). Results: In all, 40.0\% of children with ADHD had a positive CBCL-DESR profile compared with 3.5\% of controls. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that the CBCL-DESR profile cut-off (sensitivity = 97.33, specificity = 79.66, criterion ≥179, ≤210) discriminated the two subsamples. Conclusion: The findings replicate previous results highlighting the utility of the CBCL as a means of identifying DESR in children with ADHD.},

  abstract = {How sequential, verbal and visuospatial stimuli are encoded and stored in memory is not clear in cognitive psychology. Studies with order recall tasks, such as the digit, and Corsi span, indicate that order of presentation is a crucial element for verbal memory, but not for visuospatial memory. This seems to be due to the different effects of forward and backward recall in verbal and visuospatial tasks. In verbal span tasks, performance is worse when recalling things in backward sequence rather than the original forward sequence. In contrast, when it comes to visuospatial tasks, performance is not always worse for a modified backward sequence. However, worse performance in backward visuospatial recall is evident in individuals with weak visuospatial abilities; such individuals perform worse in the backward version of visuospatial tasks than in the forward version. The main aim of the present review is to summarize findings on order recall in verbal and visuospatial materials by considering both cognitive and neural correlates. The results of this review will be considered in the light of the current models of WM, and will be used to make recommendations for future studies.},

  abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been proposed as biomarkers capable of reflecting individual differences in neural processing not necessarily detectable at the behavioral level. However, the role of ERPs in developmental research could be hampered by current methodological approaches to quantification. ERPs are extracted as an average waveform over many trials; however, actual amplitudes would be misrepresented by an average if there was high trial-to-trial variability in signal latency. Low signal temporal consistency is thought to be a characteristic of immature neural systems, although consistency is not routinely measured in ERP research. The present study examined the differential contributions of signal strength and temporal consistency across trials in the error-related negativity (ERN) in 6-year-old children, as well as the developmental changes that occur in these measures. The 234 children were assessed annually in kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade. At all assessments signal strength and temporal consistency were highly correlated with the average ERN amplitude, and were not correlated with each other. Consistent with previous findings, ERN deflections in the averaged waveform increased with age. This was found to be a function of developmental increases in signal temporal consistency, whereas signal strength showed a significant decline across this time period. In addition, average ERN amplitudes showed low-to-moderate stability across the three assessments whereas signal strength was highly stable. In contrast, signal temporal consistency did not evidence rank-order stability across these ages. Signal strength appears to reflect a stable individual trait whereas developmental changes in temporal consistency may be experientially influenced.},

  abstract = {The relational structure of psychological symptoms and disorders is of crucial importance to mechanistic and causal research. Methodologically, factor analytic approaches (latent variable modeling) and network analyses are two dominant approaches. Amidst some debate about their relative merits, use of both methods simultaneously in the same data set has rarely been reported in child or adolescent psychopathology. A second issue is that the nosological structure can be enriched by inclusion of transdiagnostic constructs, such as neurocognition (e.g., executive functions and other processes). These cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries and are rarely included even though they can help map the mechanistic architecture of psychopathology. Using a sample enriched for ADHD (n\,=\,498 youth ages 6 to 17~years; M\,=\,10.8~years, SD\,=\,2.3~years, 55\% male), both approaches were used in two ways: (a) to model symptom structure and (b) to model seven neurocognitive domains hypothesized as important transdiagnostic features in ADHD and associated disorders. The structure of psychopathology domains was similar across statistical approaches with internalizing, externalizing, and neurocognitive performance clusters. Neurocognition remained a distinct domain according to both methods, showing small to moderate associations with internalizing and externalizing domains in latent variable models and high connectivity in network analyses. Overall, the latent variable and network approaches yielded more convergent than discriminant findings, suggesting that both may be complementary tools for evaluating the utility of transdiagnostic constructs for psychopathology research.},

  abstract = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the R2 statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model R2 statistic for the linear mixed model by using only a single model. The proposed R2 statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The R2 statistic arises as a 1–1 function of an appropriate F statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model with a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the R2 statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial R2 statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives a very small p-value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure (BP) compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme p-value, a very small R2 , a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated BP outcomes for the study.

  abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research fields. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

  abstract = {Objective This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between educational attainment and psychiatric disorders (i.e., mood, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders) using a nationally representative survey of US adults. Method We used data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 34,653). Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between educational attainment and a variety of past-year and incident anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders, controlling for sociodemographics and psychiatric disorder comorbidity. Results Adjusted cross-sectional data indicated that educational attainment below a graduate or professional degree at Wave 2 was associated with significantly higher odds of substance use and/or dependence disorders (adjusted odds ratio range (AORR = 1.55–2.55, P {$<$} 0.001). Longitudinal adjusted regression analyses indicated that individuals reporting less than a college education at Wave 1 were at significantly higher odds of experiencing any incident mood (AORR 1.49–1.64, P {$<$} 0.01), anxiety (AORR 1.35–1.69, P {$<$} 0.01), and substance use disorder (AORR 1.50–2.02, P {$<$} 0.01) at Wave 2 even after controlling for other sociodemographic variables and psychiatric comorbidity. Conclusion Findings lend support to other published research demonstrating that educational attainment is protective against developing a spectrum of psychiatric disorders. Mechanisms underlying this relationship are speculative and in need of additional research.},

  abstract = {A crucial role for working memory in temporary information processing and guidance of complex behavior has been recognized for many decades. There is emerging consensus that working-memory maintenance results from the interactions among long-term memory representations and basic processes, including attention, that are instantiated as reentrant loops between frontal and posterior cortical areas, as well as sub-cortical structures. The nature of such interactions can account for capacity limitations, lifespan changes, and restricted transfer after working-memory training. Recent data and models indicate that working memory may also be based on synaptic plasticity and that working memory can operate on non-consciously perceived information.},

Nowadays more and more psychological researchers are calling for more theory development, and articles on the “theory crisis” have also found their way into mainstream journals. In this article, we provide a further perspective to this theory debate. Over the past century, philosophy of science has staged extensive discussions on the mathematization of nature and on the role of mathematics in the development of theory and the connection of theory to empirical facts. We show that these discussions are highly relevant for the current debate in psychology. In particular, we emphasize the importance of conceptual work in the process of mathematization, and the role of mathematics in co-ordinating theory and observations. We then discuss the implications that these points have for statistically oriented psychology in general and for the recent theory debate in psychology.},

When instructed to use rote strategies, subjects displayed a higher Von Restorff effect and a lower recall performance than when instructed to use elaborative strategies. Furthermore the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential predicted subsequent recall only when subjects used rote strategies. When subjects used elaborative strategies, the relationship between P300 amplitude and subsequent recall was not observed. These results confirm and expand, in a within-subjects design, the results reported by Karis, Fabiani and Donchin (1984) who capitalized on different strategies used by different subjects.

Participants studied lists of stimuli containing a physical and a semantic isolate while performing a physical task or a lexical decision task. The physical-task group showed a physical but not a semantic isolation effect (IE) in free recall, whereas the lexical-decision group displayed both types of IEs. The recall of the isolates was independent of that of the other words, and isolates were usually reported separately from other words in the list. Event-related potentials recorded at encoding predicted the recall of both types of isolates. In recognition tests, the IE was obtained only when the encoding context was reinstated.

  abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the improved recall of isolated events (von Restorff effect) were investigated. Participants studied lists of stimuli containing a physical and a semantic isolate while performing a physical task or a lexical decision task. The physical-task group showed a physical but not a semantic isolation effect (IE) in free recall, whereas the lexical-decision group displayed both types of IEs. The recall of the isolates was independent of that of the other words, and isolates were usually reported separately from other words in the list. Event-related potentials recorded at encoding predicted the recall of both types of isolates. In recognition tests, the IE was obtained only when the encoding context was reinstated. These results are consistent with a model of the IE that stresses the role of the encoding processes immediately following the presentation of distinctive events, and that postulates interactions between these processes and subsequent elaboration of the stimuli.

  abstract = {Big Data bring new opportunities to modern society and challenges to data scientists. On the one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This paper gives overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasize on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogenous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data cannot be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions.},

  abstract = {Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is recruited during visual working memory (WM) when relevant information must be maintained in the presence of distracting information. The mechanism by which DLPFC might ensure successful maintenance of the contents of WM is, however, unclear; it might enhance neural maintenance of memory targets or suppress processing of distracters. To adjudicate between these possibilities, we applied time-locked transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during functional MRI, an approach that permits causal assessment of a stimulated brain region's influence on connected brain regions, and evaluated how this influence may change under different task conditions. Participants performed a visual WM task requiring retention of visual stimuli (faces or houses) across a delay during which visual distracters could be present or absent. When distracters were present, they were always from the opposite stimulus category, so that targets and distracters were represented in distinct posterior cortical areas. We then measured whether DLPFC-TMS, administered in the delay at the time point when distracters could appear, would modulate posterior regions representing memory targets or distracters. We found that DLPFC-TMS influenced posterior areas only when distracters were present and, critically, that this influence consisted of increased activity in regions representing the current memory targets. DLPFC-TMS did not affect regions representing current distracters. These results provide a new line of causal evidence for a top-down DLPFC-based control mechanism that promotes successful maintenance of relevant information in WM in the presence of distraction.},

  abstract = {ERP studies produce large spatiotemporal data sets. These rich data sets are key to enabling us to understand cognitive and neural processes. However, they also present a massive multiple comparisons problem, potentially leading to a large number of studies with false positive effects (a high Type I error rate). Standard approaches to ERP statistical analysis, which average over time windows and regions of interest, do not always control for Type I error, and their inflexibility can lead to low power to detect true effects. Mass univariate approaches offer an alternative analytic method. However, they have thus far been viewed as appropriate primarily for exploratory statistical analysis and only applicable to simple designs. Here, we present new simulation studies showing that permutation-based mass univariate tests can be employed with complex factorial designs. Most importantly, we show that mass univariate approaches provide slightly greater power than traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches when strong a priori time windows and spatial regions are used. Moreover, their power decreases only modestly when more exploratory spatiotemporal parameters are used. We argue that mass univariate approaches are preferable to traditional spatiotemporal averaging analysis approaches for many ERP studies.},

We will highlight the value of utilising advances in neuroimaging techniques to uncover answers to some of the most pressing questions in the field of early EF development. First, this review will explore the development and neural substrates of each element of EF. Second, the structural, anatomical and biochemical changes that occur in the PFC during infancy and throughout childhood will be examined, in order to address the importance of these changes for the development of EF. Third, the importance of connectivity between regions of the PFC and other brain areas in EF development is reviewed. Finally, throughout this review more recent developments in neuroimaging techniques will be addressed, alongside the implications for further elucidating the neural substrates of early EF development in the future.},

We identify serious psychometric problems that affect the reliability of models based on aptitude-achievement discrepancies and low achievement. There are also significant validity problems for models based on aptitude-achievement discrepancies and intra-individual differences. Models that incorporate RTI have considerable potential for addressing both the reliability and validity issues but cannot represent the sole criterion for LD identification. We suggest that models incorporating both low achievement and RTI concepts have the strongest evidence base and the most direct relation to treatment. The assessment of children for LD must reflect a stronger underlying classification that takes into account relations with other childhood disorders as well as the reliability and validity of the underlying classification and resultant assessment and identification system. The implications of this type of model for clinical assessments of children for whom LD is a concern are discussed.},

  abstract = {The role of the hippocampus in P300 has long been debated. Here, we present a theoretical framework that elucidates hippocampal contributions to scalp P300 based on intracranial and lesion research combined with emerging evidence on the role of the hippocampus in rapid statistical learning, memory, and novelty processing. The P300 has been divided in two subcomponents: a fronto-central P3a related to novelty and distractor processing, and a parietal P3b related to target detection. Interest in a role for hippocampus in scalp P300 was sparked by P3-like ERPs measured intracranially in human hippocampus. Subsequent medial temporal lobe lesion studies show intact scalp P3b, indicating that the hippocampus is not critical for P3b. This contrasts with the scalp P3a, which was significantly diminished in human patients with lesions in the posterior hippocampus. This suggests a differential role for hippocampus in P3a and P3b. Our framework purports that the hippocampus plays a central role in distractor processing that leads to P3a generation in cortical regions. We also propose that the hippocampus is involved at the end of the cognitive episode for both P3a and P3b implementing contextual updating. P3-like ERPs measured in hippocampus may reflect input signals from cortical regions implementing updates based on the outcome of cognitive processes underlying scalp P3, enabling a model update of the environment facilitated by the hippocampus. Overall, this framework proposes an active role for the hippocampus in novelty processing leading up to P3a generation, followed by contextual updating of the outcome of both scalp P3a and P3b.},

Traditional approaches in which experiments are designed to target a specific cognitive process have been supplemented by two recent innovations. First, formal cognitive models can decompose observed behavioral data into multiple latent cognitive processes, allowing brain measurements to be associated with a particular cognitive process more precisely and more confidently. Second, cognitive neuroscience can provide additional data to inform the development of formal cognitive models, providing greater constraint than behavioral data alone. We argue that these fields are mutually dependent; not only can models guide neuroscientific endeavors, but understanding neural mechanisms can provide key insights into formal models of cognition.},

The first study conducted a meta-analysis of the published literature since 1990 to determine the magnitude of achievement problems associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Effect sizes were significantly different between participants with and without ADHD (sample weighted r = .32, sample weighted d = . 71; p = .001). Effects were also examined according to the moderators of age, gender, achievement domain (reading, math, spelling), measurement method (standardized tests vs. grades, parent/teacher ratings, etc.), sample type (clinical vs. nonclinical), and system used to identify ADHD (DSM-III-R vs. DSM-IV). Significant differences emerged from the moderator comparisons. The second study, using averaged effect sizes from the first study as a baseline for comparison, investigated achievement levels for an understudied age group with ADHD, namely, college students. Unlike previous studies at the college level, the sample incorporated both student and parent ratings (N = 380 dyads). The results were comparable to outcomes from the meta-analysis for college students and adults. Analyses demonstrated modest (R = .21) but meaningful predictive validity across 1 year to end-of-first-year grades. However, unlike earlier studies with children and adolescents, student ratings were as predictive as parent ratings. Findings are discussed in terms of the impact of moderator variables on ADHD and achievement.},

  abstract = {Information search is key to making decision from experience: exploration permits people to learn about the statistical properties of choice options and thus to become aware of rare but potentially momentous decision consequences. This registered report investigates whether and how people differ when making decisions from experience in isolation versus under competitive pressure, which may have important implications for choice performance in different types of choice environments: in “kind” environments without any rare and extreme events, frugal search is sufficient to identify advantageous options. Conversely, in “wicked” environments with skewed outcome distributions, rare but important events will tend to be missed in frugal search. One theoretical view is that competitive pressure encourages efficiency and may thereby boost adaptive search in different environments. An alternative and more pessimistic view is that competitive pressure triggers agency-related concerns, leading to minimal search irrespective of the choice environment, and hence to inferior choice performance. Using a sampling game, the present study ( = 277) found that solitary search was not adaptive to different choice environments ( = 14 samples), leading to a high choice performance in a kind and in a moderately wicked environment, but somewhat lower performance in an extremely wicked environment. Competitive pressure substantially reduced search irrespective of the choice environment ( = 4 samples), thus negatively affecting overall choice performance. Yet, from the perspective of a cost-benefit framework, frugal search may be efficient under competitive pressure. In sum, this report extends research on decisions from experience by adopting an ecological perspective (i.e., systematically varying different choice environments) and by introducing a cost-benefit framework to evaluate solitary and competitive search — with the latter constituting a challenging problem for people in an increasingly connected world.},

  abstract = {People’s risk preferences are thought to be central to many consequential real-life decisions, making it important to identify robust correlates of this construct. Various psychological theories have put forth a series of candidate correlates, yet the strength and robustness of their associations remain unclear because of disparate operationalizations of risk preference and analytic limitations in past research. We addressed these issues with a study involving several operationalizations of risk preference (all collected from each participant in a diverse sample of the German population; N ϭ 916), and by adopting an exhaustive modeling approach—specification curve analysis. Our analyses of 6 candidate correlates (household income, sex, age, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, years of education) suggest that sex and age have robust and consistent associations with risk preference, whereas the other candidate correlates show weaker and more (domain-) specific associations (except for crystallized intelligence, for which there were no robust associations). The results further demonstrate the important role of construct operationalization when assessing people’s risk preferences: Self-reported propensity measures picked up various associations with the proposed correlates, but (incentivized) behavioral measures largely failed to do so. In short, the associations between the 6 candidate correlates and risk preference depend mostly on how risk preference is measured, rather than whether and which control variables are included in the model specifications. The present findings inform several theories that have suggested candidate correlates of risk preference, and illustrate how personality research may profit from exhaustive modeling techniques to improve theory and measurement of essential constructs.},

  abstract = {Background. Studies investigating the link between depressive symptoms and inflammation have yielded inconsistent results, which may be due to two factors. First, studies differed regarding the specific inflammatory markers studied and covariates accounted for. Second, specific depressive symptoms may be differentially related to inflammation. We address both challenges using network psychometrics. Methods. We estimated seven regularized Mixed Graphical Models in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) data (N = 2321) to explore shared variances among (1) depression severity, modeled via depression sum-score, nine DSM-5 symptoms, or 28 individual depressive symptoms; (2) inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); (3) before and after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), exercise, smoking, alcohol, and chronic diseases. Results. The depression sum-score was related to both IL-6 and CRP before, and only to IL-6 after covariate adjustment. When modeling the DSM-5 symptoms and CRP in a conceptual replication of Jokela et al., CRP was associated with ‘sleep problems’, ‘energy level’, and ‘weight/appetite changes’; only the first two links survived covariate adjustment. In a conservative model with all 38 variables, symptoms and markers were unrelated. Following recent psychometric work, we re-estimated the full model without regularization: the depressive symptoms ‘insomnia’, ‘hypersomnia’, and ‘aches and pain’ showed unique positive relations to all inflammatory markers. Conclusions. We found evidence for differential relations between markers, depressive symptoms, and covariates. Associations between symptoms and markers were attenuated after covariate adjustment; BMI and sex consistently showed strong relations with inflammatory markers.},

The capacity hypothesis states that this relationship is due to limitations in the amount of information that can be stored and held active in working memory. Previous research aimed at testing the capacity hypothesis assumed that it implies stronger relationships of intelligence test performance with WMC for test items with higher capacity demands. The present article addresses this assumption through simulations of three theoretical models implementing the capacity hypothesis while systematically varying different psychometric variables. The results show that almost any relation between the capacity demands of items and their correlation with WMC can be obtained. Therefore, the assumption made by previous studies does not hold: The capacity hypothesis does not imply stronger correlations of WMC and intelligence test items with higher capacity demands. Items varying in capacity demands cannot be used to test the causality of WMC (or any other latent variable) for fluid intelligence.},

In this review, we summarize empirical results investigating the contribution of cognitive processes associated with working memory capacity, processing speed, and executive processes to intelligence differences. Specifically, we (a) evaluate how cognitive processes associated with the three different cognitive domains have been measured, and (b) how these processes are related to individual differences in intelligence. Consistently, this review illustrates that isolating single cognitive processes using average performance in cognitive tasks is hardly possible. Instead, formal models that implement theories of cognitive processes underlying performance in different cognitive tasks may provide more adequate indicators of single cognitive processes. Therefore, we outlined which models for working memory capacity, processing speed, and executive processes may provide more specific insights into cognitive processes associated with individual differences in intelligence. Finally, we discuss implications of a process-oriented intelligence research using cognitive measurement models for psychometric theories of intelligence and argue that a model-based approach might overcome validity problems of traditional intelligence theories.},

  abstract = {Here we present an application of an EEG processing pipeline customizing EEGLAB and FieldTrip functions, specifically optimized to flexibly analyze EEG data based on single trial information. The key component of our approach is to create a comprehensive 3-D EEG data structure including all trials and all participants maintaining the original order of recording. This allows straightforward access to subsets of the data based on any information available in a behavioral data structure matched with the EEG data (experimental conditions, but also performance indicators, such accuracy or RTs of single trials). In the present study we exploit this structure to compute linear mixed models (LMMs, using lmer in R) including random intercepts and slopes for items. This information can easily be read out from the matched behavioral data, whereas it might not be accessible in traditional ERP approaches without substantial effort. We further provide easily adaptable scripts for performing cluster-based permutation tests (as implemented in FieldTrip), as a more robust alternative to traditional omnibus ANOVAs. Our approach is particularly advantageous for data with parametric within-subject covariates (e.g., performance) and/or multiple complex stimuli (such as words, faces or objects) that vary in features affecting cognitive processes and ERPs (such as word frequency, salience or familiarity), which are sometimes hard to control experimentally or might themselves constitute variables of interest. The present dataset was recorded from 40 participants who performed a visual search task on previously unfamiliar objects, presented either visually intact or blurred. MATLAB as well as R scripts are provided that can be adapted to different datasets.},

Methods: For this purpose, children with low academic achievement, with a specific learning disability based on an IQ–achievement discrepancy, and with a specific learning disability based on an achievement discrepancy, were selected out of 276 children of the first grade of regular primary schools. By means of multivariate analyses, their psychosocial functioning was compared to the functioning of children without learning problems. Results: The total set of psychosocial variables was able to discriminate between children with and without learning problems, with medium effect size. Attention problems as reported by the teachers turned out to be the most important single psychosocial predictor for group discrimination. However, results varied according to the type of learning problem and the type of psychosocial problem. Children with a specific reading/spelling disability and children with low general academic achievement differed most from their peers without learning problems with regard to their psychosocial functioning. Poor cognitive self-concept was related primarily to low academic achievement, poor learning motivation might be specific for math problems, and a low social preference score seemed most characteristic of children with a specific learning disability. Conclusions: Studying several psychosocial variables simultaneously in different groups of children with learning problems leads to a further refinement of the current knowledge.},

  abstract = {Surprisingly little scientific research has been conducted on the topic of interpersonal touch over the years, despite the importance of touch in our everyday social interactions from birth through to adulthood and old age. In this review, we critically evaluate the results of the research on this topic that have emerged from disciplines, such as cognitive and social psychology, neuroscience, and cultural anthropology. We highlight some of the most important advances to have been made in our understanding of this topic: For example, research has shown that interpersonal tactile stimulation provides an effective means of influencing people's social behaviors (such as modulating their tendency to comply with requests, in affecting people's attitudes toward specific services, in creating bonds between couples or groups, and in strengthening romantic relationships), regardless of whether or not the tactile contact itself can be remembered explicitly. What is more, interpersonal touch can be used to communicate emotion in a manner similar to that demonstrated previously in vision and audition. The recent growth of studies investigating the potential introduction of tactile sensations to long-distance communication technologies (by means of mediated or ‘virtual’ touch) are also reviewed briefly. Finally, we highlight the synergistic effort that will be needed by researchers in different disciplines if we are to develop a more complete understanding of interpersonal touch in the years to come.},

  abstract = {Differences in reading repeated/new words in adults are known to be reflected in the N400 and P600 components of event-related potentials (ERP), though the question of the functional significance of these components in the age-related trajectory of their development remains open. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the amplitudes and latencies of the N400 and P600 components in responses to repeated and new words in three age groups: preadolescent children (N = 25; age 9–11 years), adolescents (N = 17, age 12–14 years), and adults (N = 22, age 18–36 years). Age-related differences in amplitudes were seen for the N400 component averaged for leads F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, and C4 and the P600 component averaged for leads P3, Pz, and P4, while no differences in latency were seen. Comparison of the amplitudes of averaged ERP to repeated and new words identified differences in all age groups: in children in the time interval 750–850 msec, in adolescents in the time interval 650–750 msec, and in adults in the interval 600–800 msec. P600 amplitude in all age groups was greater in responses to repeated than to new words. In the case of N400, differences in responses to repeated and new words were seen only among adults, where latency to new words was shorter than latency to repeated words. The process of comparing new and previously presented verbal and visual information is evidently a multistage process. These stages are formed at different points of ontogeny and are reflected to different extents in the various ERP components. Differences between repeated and new words initially appeared in the P600 component: the pattern of differences at age 12–14 years was analogous to that in adults. At the same time, there were no differences in the N400 component in childhood and adolescence, these being present only in adults.},

A meta-analysis of 38 studies (total N=2616) was conducted to investigate the relationship of P3 measures to antisocial behavior. Reduced P3 amplitudes (d=0.252, p{$<$}.001) and longer P3 latencies (d=0.130, p=.019) were significantly associated with antisocial behavior across all electrode sites, and when using both normal and non-normal control groups. A significant moderating effect of electrode site indicated longer latencies at Fz but not Pz. Compared to non-psychopathic offenders, psychopathic offenders showed P3 amplitudes impairments in standard oddball tasks, but not other tasks. Findings suggest that reduced P3 amplitudes and prolonged P3 latencies may reflect inefficient deployment of neural resources in processing cognitive task-relevant information in individuals characterized with generic antisocial behavior (i.e., aggression, antisocial personality disorder, conduct disorder/oppositional-defiant disorder, and psychopathy), whereas this association in psychopaths may be moderated by the type of tasks.},

  abstract = {The relationship between working memory skills and performance on national curriculum assessments in English, mathematics and science was explored in groups of children aged 7 and 14 years. At 7 years, children's levels of attainment in both English and mathematics were significantly associated with working memory scores, and in particular with performance on complex span tasks. At 14 years, strong links persisted between the complex working memory test scores and attainments levels in both mathematics and science, although ability in the English assessments showed no strong association with working memory skill. The results suggest that the intellectual operations required in the curriculum areas of mathematics and science are constrained by the general capacity of working memory across the childhood years. However, whereas success in the acquisition in literacy (tapped by the English assessments at the youngest age) was also linked with working memory capacity, achievements in the higher-level skills of comprehension and analysis of English literature assessed at 14 years were independent of working memory capacity.

This study investigated nonverbal executive functions in adolescence among Taiwanese children with ADHD.         Methods:~         The sample included fifty-three 11- to 16-year-old adolescents (male, 75.5\%) with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD according to the DSM-IV criteria, and 53 age-, sex-, IQ-, and parental education-matched comparison adolescents. They were assessed using psychiatric interviews (mothers included), the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-3rd edition, and the tasks involving the executive functions of the Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery: the spatial span, spatial working memory, intradimensional/extradimensional shifts, and stocking of Cambridge. A linear multilevel model was used for data analysis for the matched case-control study design and repeated measures within the same participants.         Results:~         Forty-three adolescents (81.1\%) had persistent DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis. The ADHD group made more errors in the spatial span and spatial working memory, had more complete stage trials in the intradimensional/extradimensional shifts, and had fewer problems solved and shorter initial and subsequent thinking time in the stockings of Cambridge than the controls. The magnitudes of group differences increased with increased task difficulties. Persistent ADHD and methylphenidate did not make significant difference in executive functions.         Conclusions:~         The findings of the authors suggest that adolescents with childhood ADHD need extra assistance when they are assigned complex tasks regardless of persistence of ADHD at adolescence.},

  abstract = {Background Prevalences of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and Mental Health Disorders (MHDs) in many individual countries have been reported but there are few cross-national studies. The WHO World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative standardizes methodological factors facilitating comparison of the prevalences and associated factors of AUDs in a large number of countries to identify differences and commonalities. Methods Lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of DSM-IV AUDs, MHDs, and associations were assessed in the 29 WMH surveys using the WHO CIDI 3.0. Results Prevalence estimates of alcohol use and AUD across countries and WHO regions varied widely. Mean lifetime prevalence of alcohol use in all countries combined was 80\%, ranging from 3.8\% to 97.1\%. Combined average population lifetime and 12-month prevalence of AUDs were 8.6\% and 2.2\% respectively and 10.7\% and 4.4\% among non-abstainers. Of individuals with a lifetime AUD, 43.9\% had at least one lifetime MHD and 17.9\% of respondents with a lifetime MHD had a lifetime AUD. For most comorbidity combinations, the MHD preceded the onset of the AUD. AUD prevalence was much higher for men than women. 15\% of all lifetime AUD cases developed before age 18. Higher household income and being older at time of interview, married, and more educated, were associated with a lower risk for lifetime AUD and AUD persistence. Conclusions Prevalence of alcohol use and AUD is high overall, with large variation worldwide.

  abstract = {Plots and charts are graphical tools that make data intelligible and digestible by humans. But the oversimplification of data by only plotting the statistical summaries conflicts with the transparent communication of results. Therefore, plotting of all data are generally encouraged and this can be achieved by using a dotplot for discrete conditions. Dotplots, however, often fail to communicate whether the data are from different technical or biological replicates. The superplot has been proposed by Lord and colleagues (Lord et~al., 2020) to improve the communication of experimental design and results. To simplify the plotting of data from discrete conditions as a superplot, the SuperPlotsOfData web app was generated. The tool offers easy and open access to state-of-the-art data visualization. In addition, it incorporates recent innovations in data visualization and analysis, including raincloud plots and estimation statistics. The free, open source webtool can be accessed at: https://huygens.science.uva.nl/SuperPlotsOfData/.},

The present review briefly describes the most accepted models underlying WM and the neural networks involved in its processing. The review focuses on how the neurophysiological mechanisms develop with age in the periods from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood. Studies using behavioral, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological techniques showed the progress of WM throughout the development. The present review focuses on the neurophysiology of the basic processes underlying WM operations, as indicated by electroencephalogram-derived signals, in order to take advantage of the excellent time resolution of this technique. Children and adults use similar cerebral mechanisms and areas to encode, recognize, and keep the stimuli in memory and update the WM contents, although adults rely more on anterior sites. The possibility that a functional reorganization of WM brain processing occurs around the adolescent period is suggested, and would partly justify the high prevalence of the emergence of mental pathology in the adolescent period.},

We also examined sex differences. Participants (N = 1,339) were drawn from two multisite longitudinal studies: Fast Track and the Child Development Project. Parents reported on externalizing psychopathology in kindergarten and Grades 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. Using exploratory structural equation modeling, we found almost uniformly excellent fit across time and samples. However, we also observed multiple cross-loadings and heterogeneity in terms of which symptoms cross-loaded across time points. Alternatively, using network modeling, we observed that symptoms of attention problems and aggressive behavior had stronger connections, relative to delinquency/rule-breaking, across time and samples. Significant differences in overall connectivity were found at early (kindergarten vs. Grade 1, Grade 1 vs. Grade 2) and late (Grade 5 vs. Grade 7) time points for the combined sample and only late time points for the male sample. In addition, the items impulsive and lies or cheats consistently displayed the greatest bridge strength, that is, symptom from one dimension that connects to symptoms from another dimension, across time and samples. Our results illustrate how two methods—latent variable and network modeling—provide important and complementary information on multidimensional constructs. Findings also inform understanding of externalizing psychopathology through childhood to early adolescence by identifying key symptoms, critical transition points, and possible transdiagnostic liabilities.

  abstract = {Objective: Although several risk factors have been identified for alcohol use disorder, many individuals with these factors do not go on to develop the disorder. Identifying early phenotypic differences between vulnerable individuals and healthy control subjects could help identify those at higher risk. Binge drinking, defined as reaching a blood alcohol level of 80 mg\%, carries a risk of negative legal and health outcomes and may be an early marker of vulnerability. Using a carefully controlled experimental paradigm, the authors tested the hypothesis that risk factors for alcohol use disorder, including family history of alcoholism, male sex, impulsivity, and low level of response to alcohol, would predict rate of binging during an individual alcohol consumption session. Method: This cross-sectional study included 159 young social drinkers who completed a laboratory session in which they self-administered alcohol intravenously. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether risk factors for alcohol use disorder were associated with the rate of achieving a binge-level exposure. Results: A greater percentage of relatives with alcoholism (hazard ratio: 1.04, 95\% CI=1.02–1.07), male sex (hazard ratio: 1.74, 95\% CI=1.03–2.93), and higher impulsivity (hazard ratio: 1.17, 95\% CI=1.00 to 1.37) were associated with a higher rate of binging throughout the session. Participants with all three risk factors had the highest rate of binging throughout the session compared with the lowest risk group (hazard ratio: 5.27, 95\% CI=1.81–15.30). Conclusions: Binge drinking may be an early indicator of vulnerability to alcohol use disorder and should be carefully assessed as part of a thorough clinical evaluation.},

The field is currently in need of clearly articulated steps to theory specification and development, particularly regarding frameworks that may generalize across different fields of psychology. Here we focus on two approaches to theory specification and development that are typically associated with distinct research traditions: computational modeling and construct validation. We outline the points of convergence and divergence between them to illuminate the anatomy of a scientific theory in psychology?what a well-specified theory should contain and how it should be interrogated and revised through iterative theory-development processes. We propose how these two approaches can be used in complementary ways to increase the quality of explanations and the precision of predictions offered by psychological theories.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE National epidemiologic information from recently collected data on the new DSM-5 classification of alcohol use disorder (AUD) using a reliable, valid, and uniform data source is needed. OBJECTIVE To present nationally representative findings on the prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, associated disability, and treatment of DSM-5 AUD diagnoses overall and according to severity level (mild, moderate, or severe). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted face-to-face interviews with a representative US noninstitutionalized civilian adult (≥18 years) sample (N = 36 309) as the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III). Data were collected from April 2012 through June 2013 and analyzed in October 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD. RESULTS Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD were 13.9\% and 29.1\%, respectively. Prevalence was generally highest for men (17.6\% and 36.0\%, respectively), white (14.0\% and 32.6\%, respectively) and Native American (19.2\% and 43.4\%, respectively), respondents, and younger (26.7\% and 37.0\%, respectively) and previously married (11.4\% and 27.1\%, respectively) or never married (25.0\% and 35.5\%, respectively) adults. Prevalence of 12-month and lifetime severe AUD was greatest among respondents with the lowest income level (1.8\% and 1.5\%, respectively). Significant disability was associated with 12-month and lifetime AUD and increased with the severity of AUD. Only 19.8\% of respondents with lifetime AUD were ever treated. Significant associations were found between 12-month and lifetime AUD and other substance use disorders, major depressive and bipolar I disorders, and antisocial and borderline personality disorders across all levels of AUD severity, with odds ratios ranging from 1.2 (95\% CI, 1.08-1.36) to 6.4 (95\% CI, 5.76-7.22). Associations between AUD and panic disorder, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder were modest (odds ratios ranged from 1.2 (95\% CI, 1.01-1.43) to 1.4 (95\% CI, 1.13-1.67) across most levels of AUD severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alcohol use disorder defined by DSM-5 criteria is a highly prevalent, highly comorbid, disabling disorder that often goes untreated in the United States. The NESARC-III data indicate an urgent need to educate the public and policy makers about AUD and its treatment alternatives, to destigmatize the disorder, and to encourage those who cannot reduce their alcohol consumption on their own, despite substantial harm to themselves and others, to seek treatment.},

  abstract = {Four data sets from studies included in the Reproducibility Project were re-analyzed to demonstrate a number of flawed research practices (i.e., “bad habits”) of modern psychology. Three of the four studies were successfully replicated, but re-analysis showed that in one study most of the participants responded in a manner inconsistent with the researchers’ theoretical model. In the second study, the replicated effect was shown to be an experimental confound, and in the third study the replicated statistical effect was shown to be entirely trivial. The fourth study was an unsuccessful replication, yet re-analysis of the data showed that questioning the common assumptions of modern psychological measurement can lead to novel techniques of data analysis and potentially interesting findings missed by traditional methods of analysis. Considered together, these new analyses show that while it is true replication is a key feature of science, causal inference, modeling, and measurement are equally important and perhaps more fundamental to obtaining truly scientific knowledge of the natural world. It would therefore be prudent for psychologists to confront the limitations and flaws in their current analytical methods and research practices.},

To reduce the risk for these problems it is important to gain insight into risk factors for both school absenteeism and permanent school dropout. Until now, no quantitative overview of these risk factors and their effects was available. Therefore, this study was aimed at synthesizing the available evidence on risk factors for school absenteeism and dropout. In total, 75 studies were included that reported on 781 potential risk factors for school absenteeism and 635 potential risk factors for dropout. The risk factors were classified into 44 risk domains for school absenteeism and 42 risk domains for dropout. The results of a series of three-level meta-analyses yielded a significant mean effect for 28 school absenteeism risk domains and 23 dropout risk domains. For school absenteeism, 12 risk domains were found with large effects, including having a negative attitude towards school, substance abuse, externalizing and internalizing problems of the juvenile, and a low parent-school involvement. For dropout, the risk domains having a history of grade retention, having a low IQ or experiencing learning difficulties, and a low academic achievement showed large effects. The findings of the current study contribute to the fundamental knowledge of the etiology of school absenteeism and dropout which in turn contributes to a better understanding of the problematic development of adolescents. Further, more insight into the strength of effects of risk factors on school absenteeism and dropout is important for the development and improvement of both assessment, prevention and intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Psychology endeavors to develop theories of human capacities and behaviors on the basis of a variety of methodologies and dependent measures. We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined—what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

  abstract = {Short-term memory and working memory are two closely-related concepts that involve the prefrontal and parietal areas. These two types of memory have been evaluated by means of the spatial span task in its forward and backward conditions, respectively. To determine possible neurofunctional differences between them, this study recorded electroencephalographic activity (EEG) in the frontopolar (Fp1, Fp2), dorsolateral (F3, F4), and parietal (P3 and P4) areas during performance of the forward and backward conditions of this task in young men. The backward condition (an indicator of working memory) was characterized by fewer correct answers, higher absolute power (AP) of the delta band in dorsolateral areas, and a lower correlation between frontopolar and dorsolateral regions in the fast bands (alpha, beta and gamma), mainly in the right hemisphere. The prefrontal EEG changes during backward performance may be associated with the higher attentional demands and inhibition processes required to invert the order of reproduction of a sequence. These data provide evidence that the forward and backward conditions of the spatial span task can be distinguished on the basis of neurofunctional activity and performance, and that each one is associated with a distinct pattern of electrical activity and synchronization between prefrontal areas. The higher AP of the delta band and lower correlation of the fast bands, particularly between right prefrontal areas during the backward condition of this visuospatial task, suggest greater participation by the right prefrontal areas in working memory.},

Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, \& Cognition 37(5): 1270-1279, 2011). At the same time, models of short-term memory increasingly incorporate a distinction of order and item processing (Majerus et al. Cognition 107: 395-419, 2008). The current study is aimed to investigate whether serial order processing deficiencies in dyslexia can be traced back to a selective impairment of short-term memory for serial order and whether this impairment also affects processing beyond the verbal domain. A sample of 26 adults with dyslexia and a group of age and IQ-matched controls participated in a 2\,×\,2\,×\,2 experiment in which we assessed short-term recognition performance for order and item information, using both verbal and nonverbal material. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the type of material, participants with dyslexia recalled the individual items with the same accuracy as the matched control group, whereas the ability to recognize the serial order in which those items were presented appeared to be affected in the dyslexia group. We conclude that dyslexia is characterized by a selective impairment of short-term memory for serial order, but not for item information, and discuss the integration of these findings into current theoretical views on dyslexia and its associated dysfunctions.},

The current review incorporates experimental studies showing that manipulations that alter the significance of stimuli alter LPP amplitude. Complementing these within-person studies, also included is individual differences research on depression wherein the LPP has been used to study reduced neural sensitivity to emotional stimuli. Finally, the current review builds an existing framework that the LPP observed in studies in emotional processing and the P300 observed in classic oddball studies may reflect a common response to stimulus significance.

This duality in brain function has primarily been observed when using techniques that consider the spatial organization of the brain, such as MRI. Here, we ask whether these common and unique signals of cognition are also present in temporally sensitive but spatially insensitive neural signals. To address this question, we compiled electroencephalogram (EEG) data from individuals of both sexes while they performed multiple working memory tasks at two different data-collection sites (n = 171 and 165). Results revealed that trial-averaged EEG activity exhibited inter-electrode correlations that were stable within individuals and unique across individuals. Furthermore, models based on these inter-electrode correlations generalized across datasets to predict participants’ working memory capacity and general fluid intelligence. Thus, inter-electrode correlation patterns measured with EEG provide a signature of working memory and fluid intelligence in humans and a new framework for characterizing individual differences in cognitive abilities.},

However, during the last few decades, education has become increasingly important for employment and overall life satisfaction. In the present study, we were interested in the effects of mathematical and reading difficulties and socioemotional and behavioural problems (measured at age 16) on three educational situations at age 21: delayed graduation from upper secondary education, short educational trajectory and not being engaged in education, employment or training (NEET). The participants (N = 597; 304 females, 293 males) were one age cohort of ninth graders in general education classes, who were followed for five years after completion of compulsory education. This time frame included two different transition phases: first, from comprehensive education to upper secondary education, and second, from upper secondary education to further studies or to working life. Structural equation modelling was used as analysis method. The findings show that mathematical and reading difficulties as well as socioemotional and behavioural problems had significant long-term effects on the participants’educational careers. New in part was that these learning difficulties seemed to have somewhat divergent emphases on the three investigated life situations: (1) mathematical difficulties, more strongly than reading difficulties, caused the students to attain lower levels of education, (2) mathematical difficulties and socioemotional problems predicted a student ending up in the NEET group and (3) reading difficulties and behavioural problems predicted delayed graduation from upper secondary education.},

We critically assess claims about the medical and social benefits of use of the BDMA because the social implications are often implied as a reason to accept this model. Furthermore, we argue that the BDMA is not supported by animal and neuroimaging evidence to the extent its advocates suggest; it has not helped to deliver more effective treatments for addiction; and its effect on public policies toward drugs and people with addiction has been modest. The focus of the BDMA is on disordered neurobiology in a minority of severely addicted individuals, which undermines the implementation of effective and cost-effective policies at the population level to discourage people from smoking tobacco and drinking heavily. The pursuit of high technology direct brain interventions to cure addiction when most individuals with addiction do not have access to effective psychosocial and drug treatments is questionable.},

  abstract = {Understanding patterns of symptom co-occurrence is one of the most difficult challenges in psychopathology research. Do symptoms co-occur because of a latent factor, or might they directly and causally influence one another? Motivated by such questions, there has been a surge of interest in network analyses that emphasize the putatively direct role symptoms play in influencing each other. In this critical paper, we highlight conceptual and statistical problems with using centrality measures in cross-sectional networks. In particular, common network analyses assume that there are no unmodeled latent variables that confound symptom co-occurrence. The traditions of clinical taxonomy and test development in psychometric theory, however, greatly increase the possibility that latent variables exist in symptom data. In simulations that include latent variables, we demonstrate that closeness and betweenness are vulnerable to spurious covariance among symptoms that connect subgraphs (e.g., diagnoses). We further show that strength is redundant with factor loading in several cases. Finally, if a symptom reflects multiple latent causes, centrality metrics reflect a weighted combination, undermining their interpretability in empirical data. Our results suggest that it is essential for network psychometric approaches to examine the evidence for latent variables prior to analyzing or interpreting patterns at the symptom level. Failing to do so risks identifying spurious relationships or failing to detect causally important effects. Altogether, we argue that centrality measures do not provide solid ground for understanding the structure of psychopathology when latent confounding exists.},

  abstract = {The P300 wave is one of the cognitive components of the event-related potential (ERP) that is used to investigate the cognitive processes, and which can be used to study patient populations with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Its clinical utility has been increased by the identification of factors that contribute to the variability in its amplitude and latency. However, its value as a diagnostic index has not been entirely established. It can provide a useful recording of patients' information processing, and indicate the severity of the clinical state and its possible evolution. It can also assist in determining what therapeutic approach to adopt. In the present review, the findings in the literature concerning interindividual variation in the P300 wave are first described; several variables significantly influence the amplitude and latency of this wave, such as age, gender, intelligence and personality. Following this, the relevance of the data in the literature on the clinical applications of P300 in psychopathology is examined, including the studies undertaken to obtain an objective diagnostic index for mental disorders and also those carried out to assess the problems concerning the interpretation of information connected with the mental pathologies examined. P300-associated findings on dementia, schizophrenia, depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, anxiety disorders (panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress syndrome) and on personality disorders (schizoid, antisocial or borderline personality disorder) have been examined in detail.},

In many applications, the goal is to compare such network models across groups. In this paper, I introduce a method to estimate group differences in network models that is based on moderation analysis. This method is attractive because it allows one to make comparisons across more than two groups for all parameters within a single model and because it is implemented for all commonly used cross-sectional network models. Next to introducing the method, I evaluate the performance of the proposed method and existing approaches in a simulation study. Finally, I provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to use the proposed method to compare a network model across three groups using the R-package mgm.},

  abstract = {BackgroundNetwork analyses on psychopathological data focus on the network structure and its derivatives such as node centrality. One conclusion one can draw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is likely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes. However, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly central gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its neighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or controllability) of a node – its predictability. We introduce predictability, estimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers on psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality.MethodsWe carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18 published papers in the field (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We fit state-of-the-art network models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.ResultsPredictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most symptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets. Predictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood and anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis.ConclusionsPredictability is an important additional characterization of symptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of each node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network is, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of predictability along with future directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Idiographic modeling is rapidly gaining popularity, promising to tap into the within-person dynamics underlying psychological phenomena. To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: first, time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.},

  abstract = {Anhedonia is a condition in which the capacity of experiencing pleasure is totally or partially lost, and it refers to both a state symptom in various psychiatric disorders and a personality trait. It has a putative neural substrate, originating in the dopaminergic mesolimbic and mesocortical reward circuit. Anhedonia frequently occurs in mood disorders, as a negative symptom in schizophrenia, and in substance use disorders. In particular, we focus our attention on the relationships occurring between anhedonia and substance use disorders, as highlighted by many studies. Several authors suggested that anhedonia is an important factor involved in relapse as well as in the transition from recreational use to excessive drug intake. In particular, anhedonia has been found to be a frequent feature in alcoholics and addicted patients during acute and chronic withdrawal as well as in cocaine, stimulant, and cannabis abusers. Furthermore, in subjects with a substance dependence disorder, there is a significant correlation between anhedonia, craving, intensity of withdrawal symptoms, and psychosocial and personality characteristics. Therefore treating anhedonia in detoxified alcohol-dependent subjects could be critical in terms of relapse prevention strategies, given its strong relationship with craving.},

  abstract = {We investigated the effects of violations of the sphericity assumption on Type I error rates for different methodical approaches of repeated measures analysis using a simulation approach. In contrast to previous simulation studies on this topic, up to nine measurement occasions were considered. Effects of the level of inter-correlations between measurement occasions on Type I error rates were considered for the first time. Two populations with non-violation of the sphericity assumption, one with uncorrelated measurement occasions and one with moderately correlated measurement occasions, were generated. One population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines uncorrelated with highly correlated measurement occasions. A second population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines moderately correlated and highly correlated measurement occasions. From these four populations without any between-group effect or within-subject effect 5,000 random samples were drawn. Finally, the mean Type I error rates for Multilevel linear models (MLM) with an unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN), MLM with compound-symmetry (MLM-CS) and for repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) models (without correction, with Greenhouse-Geisser-correction, and Huynh-Feldt-correction) were computed. To examine the effect of both the sample size and the number of measurement occasions, sample sizes of n = 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 were considered as well as measurement occasions of m = 3, 6, and 9. With respect to rANOVA, the results plead for a use of rANOVA with Huynh-Feldt-correction, especially when the sphericity assumption is violated, the sample size is rather small and the number of measurement occasions is large. For MLM-UN, the results illustrate a massive progressive bias for small sample sizes (n = 20) and m = 6 or more measurement occasions. This effect could not be found in previous simulation studies with a smaller number of measurement occasions. The proportionality of bias and number of measurement occasions should be considered when MLM-UN is used. The good news is that this proportionality can be compensated by means of large sample sizes. Accordingly, MLM-UN can be recommended even for small sample sizes for about three measurement occasions and for large sample sizes for about nine measurement occasions.},

  abstract = {People often “mind wander” during everyday tasks, temporarily losing track of time, place, or current task goals. In laboratory-based tasks, mind wandering is often associated with performance decrements in behavioral variables and changes in neural recordings. Such empirical associations provide descriptive accounts of mind wandering – how it affects ongoing task performance – but fail to provide true explanatory accounts – why it affects task performance. In this perspectives paper, we consider mind wandering as a neural state or process that affects the parameters of quantitative cognitive process models, which in turn affect observed behavioral performance. Our approach thus uses cognitive process models to bridge the explanatory divide between neural and behavioral data. We provide an overview of two general frameworks for developing a model-based cognitive neuroscience of mind wandering. The first approach uses neural data to segment observed performance into a discrete mixture of latent task-related and task-unrelated states, and the second regresses single-trial measures of neural activity onto structured trial-by-trial variation in the parameters of cognitive process models. We discuss the relative merits of the two approaches, and the research questions they can answer, and highlight that both approaches allow neural data to provide additional constraint on the parameters of cognitive models, which will lead to a more precise account of the effect of mind wandering on brain and behavior. We conclude by summarizing prospects for mind wandering as conceived within a model-based cognitive neuroscience framework, highlighting the opportunities for its continued study and the benefits that arise from using well-developed quantitative techniques to study abstract theoretical constructs.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established – and thus those tasks become popular – when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects – low between-participant variability – makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10-30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

Ziel der Arbeit (Fragestellung)               Erörterung der Vor- und Nachteile der neu verfassten Diagnosekriterien.                                         Material und Methoden               Diskussion unter Berücksichtigung neurobiologischer, sozialer und klinischer Forschungsergebnisse.                                         Ergebnisse               Im ICD-11 werden wie bisher Abhängigkeitserkrankungen und schädlicher Gebrauch unterschieden. Zur Diagnose der Abhängigkeit werden die ehemals 6~Diagnosekriterien in 3 Paaren gebündelt, von denen künftig 2 erfüllt sein müssen. Innerhalb der Paare genügt ein erfülltes Kriterium, damit das Paar als bejaht gilt. Unter Bezugnahme wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse im Suchtbereich zeigen sich Vor- und Nachteile. Hierbei könnte sich die Spezifität der Diagnosestellung gegenüber dem ICD-10 verschlechtern, da pro Paar nur ein Kriterium erfüllt sein muss und somit die Möglichkeit besteht, dass nicht problematisches Konsumverhalten inkorrekt pathologisiert und falsch diagnostiziert wird. Das erscheint als problematisch, da die Definition des ICD-10 „Anhaltender Konsum trotz eindeutiger schädlicher Folgen“, im ICD-11 weiter gefasst wird als „Oft fortgeführter Konsum trotz Auftreten von Problemen“. Dies könnte dazu führen, dass das Kriterium einfach deshalb erfüllt wird, weil der Konsum einer Substanz in einem bestimmten Land illegal ist. In der bisher größten multinationalen Studie in 10~Ländern zur Konkordanz der Diagnosesysteme wurde unter Verwendung der ICD-11 die Alkoholabhängigkeit ca. 10\,\% häufiger gestellt als mittels ICD-10.                                         Schlussfolgerung               In der ICD-11 werden die Diagnosen der Substanzabhängig und des Missbrauchs als klinisch sinnvolle Syndrome aufrechterhalten. Ob die diagnostischen Neuerungen in der Praxis hilfreich sind oder beispielsweise negative soziale Auswirkungen für die Betroffenen im Sinne unangemessener Pathologisierung mit sich bringen, ist systematisch zu prüfen.                        ,              Abstract                            Background               In ICD(International Classification of Diseases)-11 the criteria for the diagnosis of substance dependence have been revised.                                         Objective               Discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the revised diagnostic criteria.                                         Material and methods               Discussion of criteria with respect to neurobiological, social and clinical research.                                         Results               In the new ICD-11, harmful drug use and substance dependence remain separate diagnostic categories. Regarding substance dependence, the former six diagnostic criteria are condensed into three pairs, two of which must be fulfilled to diagnose this disorder. Within the pairs, one affirmed symptom or aspect is sufficient for the new criterion to be fulfilled. With reference to scientific findings in the field of addiction, this appears to provide advantages as well as disadvantages. The specificity of the diagnosis of substance dependence might get worse compared to ICD-10, because only one symptom of the syndrome pairs has to be fulfilled in each newly constructed pair in order to fulfill the criterion. Therefore, the risk of false positive diagnosis of substance dependence could increase.               This is a~potential reason for concern because the definition of ICD-10 “persisting substance use despite clear evidence of overtly harmful consequences”, is more broadly reworded in ICD-11 as “substance use often continues despite the occurrence of problems”. This criterion may hence simply be fulfilled because a~substance is illegal in a~certain country. In the largest multinational study in 10~countries concerning concordance of diagnostic systems, alcohol dependence was diagnosed approximately 10\% more often using ICD-11 compared to ICD-10.                                         Conclusion               In ICD-11 the well-established distinction between substance dependence and harmful drug use is preserved. Systematic studies are required to assess whether the new diagnostic criteria are clinically helpful or increase social problems by increasing false positive diagnoses of addiction.},

  abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) are advantageous for investigating cognitive development. However, their application in infants/children is challenging given children’s difficulty in sitting through the multiple trials required in an ERP task. Thus, a large problem in developmental ERP research is high subject exclusion due to too few analyzable trials. Common analytic approaches (that involve averaging trials within subjects and excluding subjects with too few trials, as in ANOVA and linear regression) work around this problem, but do not mitigate it. Moreover, these practices can lead to inaccuracies in measuring neural signals. The greater the subject exclusion, the more problematic inaccuracies can be. We review recent developmental ERP studies to illustrate the prevalence of these issues. Critically, we demonstrate an alternative approach to ERP analysis—­ linear mixed effects (LME) modeling—which offers unique utility in developmental ERP research. We demonstrate with simulated and real ERP data from preschool children that commonly employed ANOVAs yield biased results that become more biased as subject exclusion increases. In contrast, LME models yield accurate, unbiased results even when subjects have low trial-counts, and are better able to detect real condition differences. We include tutorials and example code to facilitate LME analyses in future ERP research.},

  abstract = {This study used a stratified random sample of classes in Zurich, Switzerland, comprising approximately 2,000 students whose academic performances in math and language were assessed across primary and lower secondary education. Based on this longitudinal data, the study investigated the association of social inequalities with the baseline of, and gains in, academic performance. The study focused on growing social disparities in academic performance during compulsory education, taking into account disparities in the social backgrounds of students as well as in social deprivation of school attendance areas. The results of a multilevel growth curve analysis implemented to model academic performance development at student and school district levels suggest cumulative disadvantages for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. These students (a) start school with lower initial knowledge and (b) experience lower improvements in academic performance. The findings also suggest that more advantaged school attendance areas achieved higher average performance levels in the early stages of primary education despite controlling for student socioeconomic backgrounds. On average, however, this gap in academic performance between more advantaged and more deprived attendance areas did not appear to widen over the subsequent years of compulsory schooling.},

  abstract = {Normative thinking about addiction has traditionally been divided between, on the one hand, a medical model which sees addiction as a disease characterized by compulsive and relapsing drug use over which the addict has little or no control and, on the other, a moral model which sees addiction as a choice characterized by voluntary behavior under the control of the addict. Proponents of the former appeal to evidence showing that regular consumption of drugs causes persistent changes in the brain structures and functions known to be involved in the motivation of behavior. On this evidence, it is often concluded that becoming addicted involves a transition from voluntary, chosen drug use to non-voluntary compulsive drug use. Against this view, proponents of the moral model provide ample evidence that addictive drug use involves voluntary chosen behavior. In this article we argue that although they are right about something, both views are mistaken. We present a third model that neither rules out the view of addictive drug use as compulsive, nor that it involves voluntary chosen behavior.},

  abstract = {The combination of network theory and network psychometric methods has opened up a variety of new ways to conceptualize and study psychological disorders. The idea of psychological disorders as dynamic systems has sparked interest in developing interventions based on results of network analytic tools. However, simply estimating a network model is not sufficient for determining which symptoms might be most effective to intervene upon, nor is it sufficient for determining the potential efficacy of any given intervention. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this gap by introducing fundamental concepts of control theory to both psychometricians and applied psychologists. We introduce two controllability statistics to the psychometric literature, average and modal controllability, to facilitate selecting the best set of intervention targets. Following this introduction, we show how intervention scientists can probe the effects of both theoretical and empirical interventions on networks derived from real data and demonstrate how simulations can account for intervention cost and the desire to reduce specific symptoms. Every step is based on rich clinical EMA data from a sample of subjects undergoing treatment for complicated grief, with a focus on the outcome suicidal ideation. All methods are implemented in an open-source R package netcontrol, and complete code for replicating the analyses in this manuscript are available online.},

Research on excessive discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of immediate rewards by pre-committing to decisions, or elaborating the value of future rewards can both make decisions more future-oriented. In this article, we explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with present and future rewards, but with present and future selves. In line with thinkers who have suggested that people may fail, through a lack of belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves (; ), we propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources toward the future. In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with virtual future selves exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones.},

However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’ performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding pvalues and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

Fifty-nine papers were eligible. Academic self-efficacy moderately correlated with academic performance. Several mediating and moderating factors were identified, including effort regulation, deep processing strategies and goal orientations.

  abstract = {Advances in methods for longitudinal data collection and analysis have prompted a surge of research on psychological processes. However, decisions about how to time assessments are often not explicitly tethered to theories about psychological processes but are instead justified on methodological (e.g., power) or practical (e.g., feasibility) grounds. In many cases, methodological decisions are not explicitly justified at all. The disconnect between theories about processes and the timing of assessments in longitudinal research has contributed to misspecified models, interpretive errors, mixed findings, and nonspecific conclusions. In this article, we argue that higher demands should be placed on researchers to connect theories to methods in longitudinal research. We review instances of this disconnect and offer potential solutions as they pertain to four general questions for longitudinal researchers: how time should be scaled, how many assessments are needed, how frequently assessments should occur, and when assessments should happen.},

  abstract = {There is considerable covariation between externalizing and internalizing problems across the lifespan. Partitioning general and specific psychopathology is crucial to identify (a) processes that confer specific risk for externalizing versus internalizing problems and (b) transdiagnostic processes that confer risk for the covariation between externalizing and internalizing problems. The P3 event-related potential (ERP) component has been widely examined in relation to psychopathology in children and adults. However, prior studies have not examined the P3—or other aspects of neural functioning—in relation to general versus specific psychopathology in children. The present study examined whether children’s (N = 124, ages 3–7 years) P3 amplitudes were associated with general versus specific psychopathology. Children’s electroencephalography data were recorded during an oddball task. Parents rated their children’s externalizing and internalizing problems. Using bifactor models to partition variance in parents’ ratings of children’s psychopathology symptoms, we examined children’s P3 amplitudes simultaneously in relation to three latent factors: (1) the general factor of psychopathology—the covariation of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, (2) unique externalizing problems—the variance in externalizing problems after controlling for the general factor, and (3) unique internalizing problems. Results indicated that smaller P3 amplitudes were associated with unique externalizing problems at ages 3–5, and with general psychopathology at ages 6–7.},

Direct recordings of electrical activity in the brain provide important information about the complex dynamics of the cognitive processes and mental states that occur during learning, which can ultimately empower learners. In this article, electroencephalographic (EEG) methodologies, including the time-frequency and event-related potential techniques, are introduced, and the application of these techniques to studies of digital learning studies is discussed. Considerations of how to collect high quality data in both laboratory and real world settings are also presented, along with potential research directions. Finally, a general guideline for publishing results is offered. These issues are critical for producing useful applications of EEG studies to the digital learning research community.},

  abstract = {Reporting p values from statistical significance tests is common in psychology's empirical literature. Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an `objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis. We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values exaggerate the evidence against H0. This, in turn, calls into question the validity of much published work based on comparatively small, including .05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about the limitations of the  p value as a measure of evidence, this inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity. Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics, effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also have agreed with the need for replication research.},

  abstract = {A central goal of research on short-term memory (STM) over the past 2 decades has been to identify the mechanisms that underpin the representation of serial order, and to establish whether these mechanisms are the same across different modalities and domains (e.g., verbal, visual, spatial). A fruitful approach to addressing this question has involved comparing the transposition error latency predictions of models built from different candidate mechanisms for representing serial order. Experiments involving the output-timed serial recall of sequences of verbal (Farrell \& Lewandowsky, 2004) and spatial (Hurlstone \& Hitch, 2015) items have revealed an error latency profile consistent with the prediction of a competitive queuing mechanism within which serial order is represented via a primacy gradient of activations over items, associations between items and position markers, with suppression of items following recall. In this paper, we extend this chronometric analysis of recall errors to the serial recall of sequences of visual, nonspatial, items and find across 3 experiments an error latency profile broadly consistent with the prediction of the same representational mechanism. The findings suggest that common mechanisms and principles contribute to the representation of serial order across the verbal, visual, and spatial STM domains. The implications of these findings for theories of short-term and working memory are considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The Gaussian graphical model (GGM) has recently grown popular in psychological research, with a large body of estimation methods being proposed and discussed across various fields of study, and several algorithms being identified and recommend as applicable to psychological data sets. Such high-dimensional model estimation, however, is not trivial, and algorithms tend to perform differently in different settings. In addition, psychological research poses unique challenges, including placing a strong focus on weak edges (e.g., bridge edges), handling data measured on ordered scales, and relatively limited sample sizes. As a result, there is currently no consensus regarding which estimation procedure performs best in which setting. In this large-scale simulation study, we aimed to overcome this gap in the literature by comparing the performance of several estimation algorithms suitable for Gaussian and skewed ordered categorical data across a multitude of settings, as to arrive at concrete guidelines from applied researchers. In total, we investigated 60 different metrics across 564,000 simulated data sets. We summarized our findings through a platform that allows for manually exploring simulation results. Overall, we found that an exchange between discovery (e.g., sensitivity, edge weight correlation) and caution (e.g., specificity, precision) should always be expected, and achieving both—which is a requirement for perfect replicability—is difficult. Further, we identified that the estimation method is best chosen in light of each research question and have highlighted, alongside desirable asymptotic properties and low sample size discovery, results according to most common research questions in the field.

  abstract = {Electroencephalography is an excellent tool for assessing neurobiological and neurotransmission dysfunction. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a simple, non-invasive method of studying neurophysiology. ERPs reflect complex activity of neural networks to blame for discriminative behavior of people and recognition of novel stimuli. They are defined as brain voltage fluctuations linked in time with some physical or mental event. EEG is used to assess ERPs, and its use has grown in popularity since the 1960s. This article provides an overview of the ERP methods as well as the properties of the various ERP components (contingent negative variation, namely wave P300, Bereitschafts potential, and mismatch negativity). It also describes ERP alterations linked with neurologic and psychiatric disorders and discusses the possibility of using this technique in experimental psychology. ERPs may reveal psychophysiological characteristics in obsessive compulsive disorder patients, which may have therapeutic and pharmacological consequences. The P3 wave is the most significant and researched component of the ERP record. It is divided into two parts: P3a and P3b. The P3 wave has therapeutic significance, in addition to its application in neurophysiological and psychophysiological research. One neurophysiology indicator of cognitive impairment in depression is the P300 component of the ERPs. The severity of the illness as well as sociodemographic disparities is likely to influence individuals with neurotic disorders’ access to psychiatric care in the general community.},

I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow and Clayton [Breslow, N. E. \& Clayton, D. G. (1993). Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models. Journal of the American Statistical Society 88(421), 9–25]), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.},

In this procedure, subjects are presented with a list of words (“targets”) to be memorized (Study series). They are later tested for recognition on a word list comprised of the target words mixed randomly with an equal number of new, distractor words (Test series). Both reaction time and the P300 component of the event-related brain potential were used as measures of processing time. During the Study series, large P300s were elicited despite a word category probability of 1.0. When the words from the Study series were divided on the basis of recognition performance, words that were subsequently recognized elicited P300s with shorter latencies than unrecognized words. P300 amplitude to words in the Study series increased with repetition while maintaining a constant latency. During the Test series, P300 latency and reaction time decreased with repetition for both target and distractor words. P300 amplitude to all words increased substantially over Test repetitions with target words eliciting larger P300s than distractor words. Words that were recognized more consistently during the Test series elicited larger and earlier P300s than words that were recognized less consistently. The P300 amplitude and latency results from both the Study and Test series are interpreted as reflecting the increased discriminability of the target words as the memory trace increases in strength.},

There has been a distinct shift in research intensity over the past 10years, with a large increase in ERP studies conducted in the areas of inhibitory control and performance monitoring. Overall, the research has identified a substantial number of ERP correlates of AD/HD. Robust differences from healthy controls have been reported in early orienting, inhibitory control, and error-processing components. These data offer potential to improve our understanding of the specific brain dysfunction(s) which contribute to the disorder.

These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.},

  abstract = {Recently, researchers in clinical psychology have endeavored to create network models of the relationships between symptoms, both within and across mental disorders. Symptoms that connect two mental disorders are called "bridge symptoms." Unfortunately, no formal quantitative methods for identifying these bridge symptoms exist. Accordingly, we developed four network statistics to identify bridge symptoms: bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence. These statistics are nonspecific to the type of network estimated, making them potentially useful in individual-level psychometric networks, group-level psychometric networks, and networks outside the field of psychopathology such as social networks. We first tested the fidelity of our statistics in predicting bridge nodes in a series of simulations. Averaged across all conditions, the statistics achieved a sensitivity of 92.7\% and a specificity of 84.9\%. By simulating datasets of varying sample sizes, we tested the robustness of our statistics, confirming their suitability for network psychometrics. Furthermore, we simulated the contagion of one mental disorder to another, showing that deactivating bridge nodes prevents the spread of comorbidity (i.e., one disorder activating another). Eliminating nodes based on bridge statistics was more effective than eliminating nodes high on traditional centrality statistics in preventing comorbidity. Finally, we applied our algorithms to 18 group-level empirical comorbidity networks from published studies and discussed the implications of this analysis.},

Here, we critically examine the major psychological theories (the “mind”) of short-term memory and how they relate to evidence about underlying brain mechanisms. We focus on three features that must be addressed by any satisfactory theory of short-term memory. First, we examine the evidence for the architecture of short-term memory, with special attention to questions of capacity and how—or whether—short-term memory can be separated from long-term memory. Second, we ask how the components of that architecture enact processes of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Third, we describe the debate over the reason about forgetting from short-term memory, whether interference or decay is the cause. We close with a conceptual model tracing the representation of a single item through a short-term memory task, describing the biological mechanisms that might support psychological processes on a moment-by-moment basis as an item is encoded, maintained over a delay with some forgetting, and ultimately retrieved.},

  abstract = {Throughout social and cognitive psychology, participants are routinely asked to respond in some way to experimental stimuli that are thought to represent categories of theoretical interest. For instance, in measures of implicit attitudes, participants are primed with pictures of specific African American and White stimulus persons sampled in some way from possible stimuli that might have been used. Yet seldom is the sampling of stimuli taken into account in the analysis of the resulting data, in spite of numerous warnings about the perils of ignoring stimulus variation (Clark, 1973; Kenny, 1985; Wells \& Windschitl, 1999). Part of this failure to attend to stimulus variation is due to the demands imposed by traditional analysis of variance procedures for the analysis of data when both participants and stimuli are treated as random factors. In this article, we present a comprehensive solution using mixed models for the analysis of data with crossed random factors (e.g., participants and stimuli). We show the substantial biases inherent in analyses that ignore one or the other of the random factors, and we illustrate the substantial advantages of the mixed models approach with both hypothetical and actual, well-known data sets in social psychology (Bem, 2011; Blair, Chapleau, \& Judd, 2005; Correll, Park, Judd, \& Wittenbrink, 2002).},

  abstract = {The speed of short-term memory scanning is thought to be captured in the slope of the linear function of mean reaction times (RTs) regressed on set size in the Sternberg memory scanning task (SMST). Individual differences in the slope parameter have been hypothesized to correlate with general intelligence (g). However, this correlation can usually not be found. This present study chose a fixed-links model (FLM) approach to re-evaluate the RT slope parameter on a latent level in a sample of 102 participants aged 18 to 61 years who completed the SMST with set sizes 1, 3, and 5. The same was tried for P3 latencies to investigate whether or not both parameters measure the same cognitive processes in the SMST, and to assess the usability of both slopes to predict g. For RTs, a linear increase with set size was found. The slope of mean RTs correlated with g on a manifest level already. The FLM approach could better reveal this relationship with the correlation between the slope and g being substantially higher. For P3 latencies, we found no evidence for a linear increase, but a general increase from the smallest set size to the two larger ones. This indicates that RTs and P3 latencies do not measure the same cognitive processes in the SMST. The FLM proved suitable to investigate the association between the speed of short-term memory scanning and intelligence.},

This article aims at reviewing some of the current knowledge surrounding executive functioning and presenting the contrasting views regarding this concept. The neural substrates of the executive system are examined as well as the evolution of executive functioning, from development to decline. There is clear evidence of the vulnerability of executive functions to the effects of age over lifespan. The first executive function to emerge in children is the ability to inhibit overlearned behavior and the last to appear is verbal fluency. Inhibition of irrelevant information seems to decline earlier than set shifting and verbal fluency during senescence. The sequential progression and decline of these functions has been paralleled with the anatomical changes of the frontal lobe and its connections with other brain areas. Generalization of the results presented here are limited due to methodological differences across studies. Analysis of these differences is presented and suggestions for future research are offered.},

Furthermore, the heterogeneity in previous research is addressed by analyzing potentially relevant demographic and methodological moderators (age group, IQ, medication, comorbidity, task, cognitive function, modality, inter-stimulusinterval, number of electrodes). Via database search 52 relevant articles were identified including n = 1576 ADHD and n = 1794 non-ADHD. Using multilevel-models, pooled effect sizes were calculated. For earlier components, individuals with ADHD showed shorter Go-P100-latencies than non-ADHD. For later ERPs, individuals with ADHD showed smaller Cue-P300-amplitudes, longer Go-P300-latencies, smaller NoGo-P300amplitudes, longer NoGo-P300-latencies, smaller CNV-amplitudes, and smaller Pe-amplitudes. The substantial heterogeneity identified for most of the ERP components could be explained by the demographic and methodological moderators of interest. This meta-analysis identified relevant moderate group differences (−0.32 {$<$} d {$<$} −0.57), mainly regarding later cognitive ERPs. Nevertheless, results are characterized by substantial heterogeneity and the moderate effect sizes (d {$<$} 0.6) limit the use for clinical application.},

  abstract = {Background Comorbidities in mental disorders are often understood by assuming a common cause. The network theory of mental disorders offers an alternative to this assumption by understanding comorbidities as mutually reinforced problems. In this study, we used network analysis to examine bridge symptoms between anxiety and depression in a large sample. Method Using data from a sample of patients diagnosed with both depression and an anxiety disorder before and after inpatient treatment (N = 5,614, mean age: 42.24, 63.59\% female, average treatment duration: 48.12 days), network models of depression and anxiety symptoms are estimated. Topology, the centrality of nodes, stability, and changes in network structure are analyzed. Symptoms that drive comorbidity are determined by bridge node analysis. As an alternative to network communities based on categorical diagnosis, we performed a community analysis and propose empirically derived symptom subsets. Results The obtained network models are highly stable. Sad mood and the inability to control worry are the most central. Psychomotor agitation or retardation is the strongest bridge node between anxiety and depression, followed by concentration problems and restlessness. Changes in appetite and suicidality were unique to depression. Community analysis revealed four symptom groups. Conclusion The estimated network structure of depression and anxiety symptoms proves to be highly accurate. Results indicate that some symptoms are considerably more influential than others and that only a small number of predominantly physical symptoms are strong candidates for explaining comorbidity. Future studies should include physiological measures in network models to provide a more accurate understanding.},

Fifty young and 50 healthy older adults completed a simple visual oddball task including an infrequent (20\%) target stimulus. A temporo-spatial principal component (PCA) analysis was used to disentangle the parietal P300 and frontal P3a from overlapping ERP components. The typical age-related anterior-shift of the P300 was, according to the PCA, due to a disproportionately large contribution of a frontal P3a in older adults.

A novel finding was that with further increases in preceding standards, P300 amplitude to targets gradually decreased. This pattern is consistent with a combination of relatively automatic, temporary expectations and higher level, conscious expectations driving P300 sequential effects, with different dynamics over the course of successively presented standards. However, an expectancy-based account of these sequential effects was challenged by an analogous analysis of RTs.

In this review, we focus primarily on short-term sensitization of the gill and siphon reflex in the marine mollusk, Aplysia californica. Analyses of this form of learning provide direct evidence that protein phosphorylation dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate can modulate synaptic action.

Rather than provide a novel theory of PFC function, we synthesize a wealth of singlecell, brain-imaging, and neuropsychological research through the lens of our theory of normal individual differences in WMC and attention control (Engle, Kane, \& Tuholski, 1999; Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, \& Conway, 1999). Our critical review confirms the prevalent view that dorsolateral PFC circuitry is critical to executive-attention functions. Moreover, although the dorsolateral PFC is but one critical structure in a network of anterior and posterior “attention control” areas, it does have a unique executiveattention role in actively maintaining access to stimulus representations and goals in interference-rich contexts. Our review suggests the utility of an executive-attention framework for guiding future research on both PFC function and cognitive control.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveA repeated finding regarding event-related potentials (ERPs) is that patients with ADHD show a reduced P300 amplitude. This raises the question of whether the attention of ADHD patients can be increased by stabilizing the P300. Assuming that the P300 is generated by event-related oscillations (EROs) in the low frequency range (0–8 Hz), one approach to increase the P300 could be to stimulate the patient’s P300 underlying ERO by means of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The aim of this follow-up study was to investigate this hypothesized mechanism of action in adult ADHD patients.Materials and MethodsUndergoing a crossover design, 20 adult ADHD patients (10 female) received an actual stimulation via tACS on one day and a sham stimulation on another day. Before and after each intervention, EEG characteristics (P300 amplitudes, low frequency power) and attention performances (d2 attention test, visual oddball task (VOT)) were recorded.ResultsElectrophysiological analyses revealed no evidence for an enhanced P300 amplitude or low frequency power increase after actual stimulation compared to sham stimulation. Instead, a significant effect was found for a stronger N700 amplitude increase after actual stimulation compared to sham stimulation. Consistent with the P300 null results, none of the examined neuropsychological performance measures indicated a tACS-induced improvement in attentional ability.ConclusionContrary to a previous study using tACS to modulate the P300 in adult ADHD patients, the current study yields no evidence that tACS can increase the P300 amplitude in adult ADHD patients and that such P300 enhancement can directly improve neuropsychological parameters of attention.},

  abstract = {Computational models have been used to analyze the data from behavioral experiments. One objective of the use of computational models is to estimate model parameters or internal variables for individual subjects from behavioral data. The estimates are often correlated with other variables that characterize subjects in order to investigate which computational processes are associated with specific personal or physiological traits. Although the accuracy of the estimates is important for these purposes, the parameter estimates obtained from individual subject data are often unreliable. To solve this problem, researchers have begun to use hierarchical modeling approaches to estimate parameters of computational models from multiple-subject data. It is widely accepted that the hierarchical model provides reliable estimates compared to other non-hierarchical approaches. However, how and under what conditions the hierarchical models provide better estimates than other approaches has yet to be systematically investigated. This study attempts to investigate these issues, focusing on two measures of estimation accuracy: the correlation between estimates of individual parameters and subject trait variables and the absolute measures of error (root mean squared error, RMSE) of the estimates. An analytical calculation based on a simple Gaussian model clarifies how the hierarchical model improves the point estimates of these two measures. We also performed simulation studies employing several realistic computational models based on the synthesized data to confirm that the theoretical properties hold in realistic situations.},

  abstract = {How are sequences of events that are temporarily stored in a cognitive working memory unitized, or chunked, through learning? Such sequential learning is needed by the brain in order to enable language, spatial understanding, and motor skills to develop. In particular, how does the brain learn categories, or list chunks, that become selectively tuned to different temporal sequences of items in lists of variable length as they are stored in working memory, and how does this learning process occur in real time? The present article introduces a neural model that simulates learning of such list chunks. In this model, sequences of items are temporarily stored in an Item-and-Order, or competitive queuing, working memory before learning categorizes them using a categorization network, called a Masking Field, which is a self-similar, multiple-scale, recurrent on-center off-surround network that can weigh the evidence for variable-length sequences of items as they are stored in the working memory through time. A Masking Field hereby activates the learned list chunks that represent the most predictive item groupings at any time, while suppressing less predictive chunks. In a network with a given number of input items, all possible ordered sets of these item sequences, up to a fixed length, can be learned with unsupervised or supervised learning. The self-similar multiple-scale properties of Masking Fields interacting with an Item-and-Order working memory provide a natural explanation of George Miller's Magical Number Seven and Nelson Cowan's Magical Number Four. The article explains why linguistic, spatial, and action event sequences may all be stored by Item-and-Order working memories that obey similar design principles, and thus how the current results may apply across modalities. Item-and-Order properties may readily be extended to Item-Order-Rank working memories in which the same item can be stored in multiple list positions, or ranks, as in the list ABADBD. Comparisons with other models, including TRACE, MERGE, and TISK, are made.},

In children, the target stimuli that were preceded by a large number of standard stimuli elicited about twice as large P300 with a significantly shorter latency, a more widespread distribution, and an earlier positivity in the frontal area than those that were preceded by a small number of standard stimuli. The P300 variation was not as marked in adults as in children. Based on the context updating theory of the P300, the finding suggests that a long intertarget interval (ITI) results in a profound decay of the neural representation of the target stimulus in children; consequently, more resources are needed to update the neural representation, and the target may even be processed as a novel input. The P300 variation may provide information about the brain functions related to memory, attention, and orienting in children. This variation should be considered when assessing cognitive brain functions with event-related potentials in children.},

Methods A sample of 30 college students currently meeting a diagnosis of ADHD and 25 typically developing students, matched on age and gender, performed a delayed match-to-sample task with low and high memory load conditions. Dense-array electroencephalography was recorded. Specifically, the P3, an event related potential (ERP) associated with WM, was examined because of its relation with attentional allocation during WM. Task performance (accuracy, reaction time) as well as performance on other neuropsychological tasks of WM was analyzed. Results Neural differences were found between the groups. Specifically, the P3 amplitude was smaller in the ADHD group compared to the comparison group for both load conditions at parietal–occipital sites. Lower scores on behavioural working memory tasks were suggestive of impaired behavioural WM performance in the ADHD group. Conclusions Findings from this study provide the first evidence of neural differences in the encoding stage of WM in young adults with ADHD, suggesting ineffective allocation of attentional resources involved in encoding of information in WM. Significance These findings, reflecting alternate neural functioning of WM, may explain some of the difficulties related to WM functioning that college students with ADHD report in their every day cognitive functioning.},

Given that cognitive impairment has devastating effects, enhancing this in patients should lead to improvements in compromised quality of life and functioning, including vocational functioning. Over the past 50 years, several attempts have been made to improve impaired cognition, and empirical evidence for cognitive remediation (CR) has accumulated that supports its efficacy for treating schizophrenia. More recently, CR has been successfully applied in the treatment of depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and anorexia nervosa. This study critically reviews recent CR studies and suggests their future direction.

In this review, we discuss the opportunities that these efforts offer for the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience. We focus on issues broadly related to statistical power and to flexibility and transparency in data analyses. Critical considerations relating to statistical power include challenges in recruitment and testing of young populations, how to increase the value of studies with small samples, and the opportunities and challenges related to working with large-scale datasets. Developmental studies also involve challenges such as choices about age groupings, modelling across the lifespan, the analyses of longitudinal changes, and neuroimaging data that can be processed and analyzed in a multitude of ways. Flexibility in data acquisition, analyses and description may thereby greatly impact results. We discuss methods for improving transparency in developmental cognitive neuroscience, and how preregistration of studies can improve methodological rigor in the field. While outlining challenges and issues that may arise before, during, and after data collection, solutions and resources are highlighted aiding to overcome some of these. Since the number of useful tools and techniques is ever-growing, we highlight the fact that many practices can be implemented stepwise.},

  abstract = {Researchers in clinical psychophysiology make several methodological decisions during the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). In the current study, we review these choices from the perspective of individual differences. We focus on baseline period and reference scheme (i.e., average, mastoid, current source density)− as well as choices regarding where (i.e., single electrode site vs. pooling of sites), when (i.e., area, area around peak) and how (i.e., subtraction- or regression-based difference scores) to quantify ERPs. To illustrate the impact of these analytic pathways on internal consistency reliability and individual differences, we focus on the error-related negativity (ERN) and anxiety—and present data from two samples: first, in adults with diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); second, in relation to continuous self-reported symptoms of GAD in a large community sample of adolescent females. Results generally indicated similar internal consistency and between-subject effect sizes across all evaluated methods. Nonetheless, some patterns of variation emerged, such as that across both datasets difference-based ERN measures, especially with mastoid reference, yielded more robust associations with GAD diagnosis and symptoms, despite somewhat lower internal consistency. The current analyses suggest that the association between ERN and anxiety is robust across a range of commonly used methodological choices. The present study is an example of how systematic analyses of analytic strategies on measures of internal consistency and between-subject variability could help inform individual differences ERP research., This study systematically explores the effects of different EEG analytic choices on the internal consistency of a neural measure and its relation to symptoms of anxiety in two independent data sets. Results indicate psychometric properties of the error-related negativity (ERN) are robust across a range of commonly used methodological choices.},

Methods Participants were instructed to copy spell a sentence by attending to cells of a randomly flashing 7*7 matrix. Motivation was manipulated by monetary reward. In two experimental groups participants received 25 (N=11) or 50 (N=11) Euro cent for each correctly selected character; the control group (N=11) was not rewarded. BCI performance was defined as the overall percentage of correctly selected characters (correct response rate=CRR). Results Participants performed at an average of 99\%. At electrode location Cz the P300 amplitude was positively correlated to self-rated motivation. The P300 amplitude of the most motivated participants was significantly higher than that of the least motivated participants. Highly motivated participants were able to communicate correctly faster with the ERP-BCI than less motivated participants. Conclusions Motivation modulates the P300 amplitude in an ERP-BCI. Significance Motivation may contribute to variance in BCI performance and should be monitored in BCI settings.},

  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Introduction:}} Persistent medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are a major burden for health care. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is efficacious for patients with MUS, with small to medium effects. The current study investigates whether therapy outcomes of a CBT for MUS patients can be improved by complementing it with emotion regulation training. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} In a multicentre trial 255 patients with at least three persisting MUS were randomised to 20 sessions of either conventional CBT (\emph{n} = 128) or CBT complemented with emotion regulation training (ENCERT; \emph{n} = 127). Somatic symptom severity and secondary outcomes were assessed at pre-treatment, therapy session 8, end of therapy, and 6-month follow-up. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} Linear mixed-effect models revealed medium to large effects in both study arms for almost all outcomes at the end of therapy and 6-month follow-up. ENCERT and CBT did not differ in their effect on the primary outcome (\emph{d} = 0.20, 95\% CI: –0.04 to 0.44). Significant time × group cross-level interactions suggested ENCERT to be of more benefit than conventional CBT for a few secondary outcomes. Moderator analyses revealed higher effects of ENCERT in patients with co-morbid mental disorders. \textbf{\emph{Discussion/Conclusions:}} Current findings are based on a representative sample. Results demonstrate that both CBT and ENCERT can achieve strong effects on primary and secondary outcomes in MUS patients. Our results do not indicate that adding a training in emotion regulation skills generally improves the effect of CBT across all patients with MUS. Large effect sizes of both treatments and potential specific benefits of ENCERT for patients with co-morbid mental disorders are discussed.},

  abstract = {I argue that our current practice of ascribing the term ‘memory’ to mental states and processes lacks epistemic warrant. Memory, according to the ‘received view’, is any state or process that results from the sequential stages of encoding, storage, and retrieval. By these criteria, memory, or its footprint, can be seen in virtually every mental state we are capable of having. This, I argue, stretches the term to the breaking point. I draw on phenomenological, historical, and conceptual considerations to make the case that an act of memory entails a direct, non-inferential feeling of reacquaintance with one's past. It does so by linking content retrieved from storage with autonoetic awareness during retrieval. On this view, memory is not the content of experience, but the manner in which that content is experienced. I discuss some theoretical and practical implications and advantages of adopting this more circumscribed view of memory.

We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and long-term effectiveness of DBT. Method: Systematic bibliographic research was undertaken to find relevant literature from online databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, PsychSpider, Medline). We excluded studies in which patients with diagnoses other than BPD were treated, the treatment did not comprise all components specified in the DBT manual or in the suggestions for inpatient DBT programs, patients failed to be diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the intervention group comprised fewer than 10 patients. Using a mixed-effect hierarchical modeling approach, we calculated global effect sizes and effect sizes for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors. Results: Calculations of postintervention global effect sizes were based on 16 studies. Of these, 8 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 8 were neither randomized nor controlled (nRCT). The dropout rate was 27.3\% pre- to posttreatment. A moderate global effect and a moderate effect size for suicidal and self-injurious behaviors were found, when including a moderator for RCTs with borderline-specific treatments. There was no evidence for the influence of other moderators (e.g., quality of studies, setting, duration of intervention). A small impairment was shown from posttreatment to follow-up, including 5 RCTs only. Conclusions: Future research should compare DBT with other active borderline-specific treatments that have also demonstrated their efficacy using several long-term follow-up assessment points.

Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to measure brain activity in subjects between 9 and 18 years of age while they performed a visuospatial WM task and a baseline task. During performance of the WM task, the older children showed higher activation of cortex in the superior frontal and intraparietal cortex than the younger children did. A second analysis found that WM capacity was significantly correlated with brain activity in the same regions. These frontal and parietal areas are known to be involved in the control of attention and spatial WM. The development of the functionality in these areas may play an important role in cognitive development during childhood.},

  abstract = {During evolution, the cerebral cortex advances by increasing in surface and the introduction of new cytoarchitectonic areas among which the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is considered to be the substrate of highest cognitive functions. Although neurons of the PFC are generated before birth, the differentiation of its neurons and development of synaptic connections in humans extend to the 3rd decade of life. During this period, synapses as well as neurotransmitter~systems including their receptors~and transporters, are initially overproduced followed by selective elimination. Advanced methods applied to human and animal models, enable investigation of the cellular mechanisms and role of specific genes, non-coding regulatory elements and signaling molecules in control of prefrontal~neuronal production~and phenotypic fate, as well as neuronal~migration to establish layering of~the PFC. Likewise, various genetic approaches in combination with functional assays and~immunohistochemical and imaging methods reveal roles of neurotransmitter~systems during maturation of the PFC. Disruption, or even a slight slowing of the rate of neuronal production, migration and synaptogenesis by genetic or environmental factors, can induce gross as well as subtle changes that eventually can lead to cognitive impairment. An understanding of the development and evolution of the PFC provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of congenital neuropsychiatric diseases as well as idiopathic developmental disorders that cause intellectual disabilities.},

  abstract = {It has long been recognized that the amplitude of the P300 component of event-related brain potentials is sensitive to the degree to which eliciting stimuli are surprising to the observers (Donchin, 1981). While Squires et al. (1976) showed and modeled dependencies of P300 amplitudes from observed stimuli on various time scales, Mars et al. (2008) proposed a computational model keeping track of stimulus probabilities on a long-term time scale. We suggest here a computational model which integrates prior information with short-term, long-term, and alternation-based experiential influences on P300 amplitude fluctuations. To evaluate the new model, we measured trial-by-trial P300 amplitude fluctuations in a simple two-choice response time task, and tested the computational models of trial-by-trial P300 amplitudes using Bayesian model evaluation. The results reveal that the new digital filtering (DIF) model provides a superior account of the trial-by-trial P300 amplitudes when compared to both Squires et al.’s (1976) model, and Mars et al.’s (2008) model. We show that the P300-generating system can be described as two parallel first-order infinite impulse response (IIR) low-pass filters and an additional fourth-order finite impulse response (FIR) high-pass filter. Implications of the acquired data are discussed with regard to the neurobiological distinction between short-term, long-term, and working memory as well as from the point of view of predictive coding models and Bayesian learning theories of cortical function.},

  abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been widely used to investigate brain functioning in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in both research and diagnostic settings. To ensure the efficiency of ERP techniques in ADHD diagnosis and in longitudinal observational studies, the test-retest reliability of the affected population must be validated. Thus, the present article assesses the short-term test-retest reliability of certain early and late ERPs (i.e., P1, N1, N2, P2, P3), as well as independent components (ICs) decomposed from the above mentioned ERPs (IC P3 Go, IC P3 NoGo early, IC P3 NoGo late) relevant to ADHD, through the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). More specifically, we employ a cued visual Go/NoGo paradigm for recording ERPs from 22 children with ADHD (mean age 12.2), twice within 30min. Amplitudes and latencies are calculated by the ‘peak amplitude’ method and by a variation of the fractional area. Results for amplitudes lie mostly within the ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ range for both measurement methods, while ICC for latencies is more variable ranging from ‘poor’ to ‘excellent’ results. Crucially, the ICs, which are associated with distinct functionally independent processes of the executive attentional system have shown a comparable test-retest reliability with the raw ERPs. Our results are consistent with other reliability studies of neurotypical population in the literature, and as such, consist initial evidence that ERPs could be reliable neurophysiological markers for the ADHD population.},

Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in compulsive drug use and a loss of control over drug-taking. Sensitization and counteradaptation are hypothesized to contribute to this hedonic homeostatic dysregulation, and the neurobiological mechanisms involved, such as the mesolimbic dopamine system, opioid peptidergic systems, and brain and hormonal stress systems, are beginning to be characterized. This framework provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and to relapse in individuals with a history of addiction.},

  abstract = {The capability of the human brain for Bayesian inference was assessed by manipulating probabilistic contingencies in an urn-ball task. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to stimuli that differed in their relative frequency of occurrence (.18 to .82). A veraged ERPs with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (relative frequency of occurrence {$>$} .5) were used for further analysis. Research hypotheses about relationships between probabilistic contingencies and ERP amplitude variations were formalized as (in-)equality constrained hypotheses. Conducting Bayesian model comparisons, we found that manipulations of prior probabilities and likelihoods were associated with separately modifiable and distinct ERP responses. P3a amplitudes were sensitive to the degree of prior certainty such that higher prior probabilities were related to larger frontally distributed P3a waves. P3b amplitudes were sensitive to the degree of likelihood certainty such that lower likelihoods were associated with larger parietally distributed P3b waves. These ERP data suggest that these antecedents of Bayesian inference (prior probabilities and likelihoods) are coded by the human brain.},

We conducted five passive oddball experiments, in which the number of deviants (i.e., one or two), their alleged meaning, and their distinctiveness varied.ResultsMastoid- or common-referenced waveforms showed a fronto-central N3 in all experiments. The data were CSD (Current Source Density) transformed and underwent a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA revealed N3 containing two subcomponents with very stable peak latencies of about 415 and 455 ms, respectively. Both topography of the subcomponents and their variation with experimental conditions were very similar, indicating a midfrontal sink and a posterior temporal source. An analysis of P3a and P3b components replicated previously known effects.ConclusionWe discuss the similarities and differences between the passive N3 and other components including the MMN, N1, late positive Slow Wave, and reorienting negativity. We also make general hypotheses about a possible functional meaning of N3; on this basis, specific hypotheses are formulated and further experiments are suggested to test these hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The present study examines the relationships between processing speed (PS), mental health disorders, and learning disorders. Prior work has tended to explore relationships between PS deficits and specific diagnoses in isolation of one another. Here, we simultaneously investigated PS associations with five diagnoses (i.e., anxiety, autism, ADHD, depressive, specific learning) in a large-scale, transdiagnostic, community self-referred sample. Method. 843 children, ages 8–16 were included from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Biobank. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to create a composite measure of four PS tasks, referred to as PC1. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the four PS measures, as well as PC1, were calculated to assess reliability. Results. ICCs were moderate between WISC-V tasks (0.663), and relatively modest between NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison and other PS scales (0.14–0.27). Regression analyses revealed specific significant relationships between PS and reading and math disabilities, ADHD-inattentive presentation (ADHD-I), and ADHD-combined presentation (ADHD-C). After accounting for inattention, the present study did not find a significant relationship with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Discussion. Our examination of PS in a large, transdiagnostic sample suggested more specific associations with ADHD and learning disorders than the literature currently suggests. Implications for understanding how PS interacts with a highly heterogeneous childhood sample are discussed.},

Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package).

We review how addictive disorders (ADs) are presently diagnosed and the need for new neuroclinical measures to differentiate patients who meet clinical criteria for addiction to the same agent while differing in etiology, prognosis, and treatment response. The need for a better understanding of the mechanisms provoking and maintaining addiction, as evidenced by the limitations of current treatments and within-diagnosis clinical heterogeneity, is articulated. In addition, recent changes in the nosology of ADs, challenges to current classification systems, and prior attempts to subtype individuals with ADs are described. Complementary initiatives, including the Research Domain Criteria project, that have established frameworks for the neuroscience of psychiatric disorders are discussed. Three domains—executive function, incentive salience, and negative emotionality—tied to different phases in the cycle of addiction form the core functional elements of ADs. Measurement of these domains in epidemiologic, genetic, clinical, and treatment studies will provide the underpinnings for an understanding of cross-population and temporal variation in addictions, shared mechanisms in addictive disorders, impact of changing environmental influences, and gene identification. Finally, we show that it is practical to implement such a deep neuroclinical assessment using a combination of neuroimaging and performance measures. Neuroclinical assessment is key to reconceptualizing the nosology of ADs on the basis of process and etiology, an advance that can lead to improved prevention and treatment.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are among the most common and debilitating illnesses across the lifespan and begin usually during childhood and adolescence, which emphasizes the importance of studying the developing brain. Most of the previous pediatric neuroimaging studies employed traditional univariate statistics on relatively small samples. Multivariate machine learning approaches have a great potential to overcome the limitations of these approaches. On the other hand, the vast majority of existing multivariate machine learning studies have focused on differentiating between children with an isolated psychiatric disorder and typically developing children. However, this line of research does not reflect the real-life situation as the majority of children with a clinical diagnosis have multiple psychiatric disorders (multimorbidity), and consequently, a clinician has the task to choose between different diagnoses and/or the combination of multiple diagnoses. Thus, the goal of the present benchmark is to predict psychiatric multimorbidity in children and adolescents. For this purpose, we implemented two kinds of machine learning benchmark challenges: The first challenge targets the prediction of the seven most prevalent DSM-V psychiatric diagnoses for the available data set, of which each individual can exhibit multiple ones concurrently (i.e. multi-task multi-label classification). Based on behavioral and cognitive measures, a second challenge focuses on predicting psychiatric symptom severity on a dimensional level (i.e. multiple regression task). For the present benchmark challenges, we will leverage existing and future data from the biobank of the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) initiative, which offers a unique large-sample dataset (N~=~2042) that provides a wide array of different psychiatric developmental disorders and true hidden data sets. Due to limited real-world practicability and economic viability of MRI measurements, the present challenge will permit only resting state EEG data and demographic information to derive predictive models. We believe that a community driven effort to derive predictive markers from these data using advanced machine learning algorithms can help to improve the diagnosis of psychiatric developmental disorders.},

Averaging, however, ignores the variability due to the single-trial ERPs that constitute the traditional average ERP. This variability may reflect complementary functional information to the average measure. Our group applied a simple procedure, the response variance curve (RVC), which measures single-trial ERP variability relative to their average. In this study, the average ERP and RVC measures (generated from the same single-trial task-relevant target ERPs) were assessed in an auditory oddball paradigm, in 17 unmedicated male adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in 17 age- and sex-matched normal controls. P300 amplitude, latency and point of maximum variability of the RVC were measured within the P300 processing window (250–500 ms post-stimulus). There were no significant differences in P300 amplitude or latency between the groups. Unmedicated ADHD patients, however, showed significantly increased single-trial variability within the P300 window compared with controls. This variability was significantly reduced with stimulant medication.},

  abstract = {Objective: To review deficits in emotional processing and social cognition potentially contributing to the dysfunctional emotion regulation and difficulties with interpersonal relationships observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and to provide directions for future research. Method: First is presented a review of emotional and social cognitive impairments in recently detoxified AUD individuals that include alexithymia, difficulties in decoding others’ emotions, and reduced theory of mind and empathy skills. Social cognition disorders in AUD pose different issues discussed, such as whether (1) these deficits are consequences of excessive alcohol consumption or premorbid risk factors for addiction, (2) emotional and social impairments impede positive treatment outcome, (3) recovery of social abilities is possible with sustained abstinence, and (4) AUD patients are unaware of their emotional and social dysfunctions. Finally, current knowledge on structural and functional brain correlates of these deficits in AUD are reviewed. Results: Emotional and social cognitive functions affected in AUD can potentially compromise efforts to initiate and maintain abstinence by hampering efficacy of clinical treatment. Such dysfunction can obstruct efforts to enable or re-instate higher-order abilities such as emotional self-regulation, motivation to change, success in interpersonal/social interactions, and emotional insight and awareness of social dysfunctions (i.e., accurate metacognition). Conclusions: The present review highlights the need to account for emotional processing and social cognition in the evaluation and rehabilitation of alcohol-related neurocognitive disorders and to consider psychotherapeutic treatment involving remediation of emotional and social skills as implemented in psychiatric and neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {We develop and evaluate a model of behavior on the Give-N task, a commonly used measure of young children's number knowledge. Our model uses the knower-level theory of how children represent numbers. To produce behavior on the Give-N task, the model assumes that children start out with a base rate that makes some answers more likely a priori than others but is updated on each experimental trial in a way that depends on the interaction between the experimenter's request and the child's knower level. We formalize this process as a generative graphical model, so that the parameters—including the base rate distribution and each child's knower level—can be inferred from data using Bayesian methods. Using this approach, we evaluate the model on previously published data from 82 children spanning the whole developmental range. The model provides an excellent fit to these data, and the inferences about the base rate and knower levels are interpretable and insightful. We discuss how our modeling approach can be extended to other developmental tasks and can be used to help evaluate alternative theories of number representation against the knower-level theory.},

  abstract = {The limited capacity of recent memory inevitably leads to partial memory of past stimuli. There is also evidence that behavioral and neural responses to novel or rare stimuli are dependent on one’s memory of past stimuli. Thus, these responses may serve as a probe of different individuals’ remembering and forgetting characteristics. Here, we utilize two lossy compression models of stimulus sequences that inherently involve forgetting, which in addition to being a necessity under many conditions, also has theoretical and behavioral advantages. One model is based on a simple stimulus counter and the other on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework which suggests a more general, theoretically justifiable principle for biological and cognitive phenomena. These models are applied to analyze a novelty-detection event-related potential commonly known as the P300. The trial-by-trial variations of the P300 response, recorded in an auditory oddball paradigm, were subjected to each model to extract two stimulus-compression parameters for each subject: memory length and representation accuracy. These parameters were then utilized to estimate the subjects’ recent memory capacity limit under the task conditions. The results, along with recently published findings on single neurons and the IB model, underscore how a lossy compression framework can be utilized to account for trial-by-trial variability of neural responses at different spatial scales and in different individuals, while at the same time providing estimates of individual memory characteristics at different levels of representation using a theoretically-based parsimonious model.},

I argue that neural dysfunction is not sufficient for disease: something is a brain disease only when neural dysfunction is sufficient for impairment. I claim that the neural dysfunction that is characteristic of addiction is not sufficient for impairment, because people who suffer from that dysfunction are impaired, sufficiently to count as diseased, only given certain features of their context. Hence addiction is not a brain disease (though it is often a disease, and it may always involve brain dysfunction). I argue that accepting that addiction is not a brain disease does not entail a moralizing attitude toward people who suffer as a result of addiction; if anything, it allows for a more compassionate, and more effective, response to addiction.},

  abstract = {There is a broad agreement that psychology is facing a replication crisis. Even some seemingly well-established findings have failed to replicate. Numerous causes of the crisis have been identified, such as underpowered studies, publication bias, imprecise theories, and inadequate statistical procedures. The replication crisis is real, but it is less clear how it should be resolved. Here we examine potential solutions by modeling a scientific community under various different replication regimes. In one regime, all findings are replicated before publication to guard against subsequent replication failures. In an alternative regime, individual studies are published and are replicated after publication, but only if they attract the community’s interest. We find that the publication of potentially non-replicable studies minimizes cost and maximizes efficiency of knowledge gain for the scientific community under a variety of assumptions. Provided it is properly managed, our findings suggest that low replicability can support robust and efficient science.},

  abstract = {The major advantage of MEG/EEG over other neuroimaging methods is its high temporal resolution. Examining the latency of well-studied components can provide a window into the dynamics of cognitive operations beyond traditional response-time (RT) measurements. While RTs reflect the cumulative duration of all time-consuming cognitive operations involved in a task, component latencies can partition this time into cognitively meaningful sub-steps. Surprisingly, most MEG/EEG studies neglect this advantage and restrict analyses to component amplitudes without considering latencies. The major reasons for this neglect might be that, first, the most easily accessible latency measure (peak latency) is often unreliable and that, second, more complex measures are difficult to conceive, implement, and parametrize. The present article illustrates the key advantages and disadvantages of the three main types of latency-measures (peak latency, onset latency, and percent-area latency), introduces a MATLAB function that extracts all these measures and is compatible with common analysis tools, discusses the most important parameter choices for different research questions and components of interest, and demonstrates its use by various group analyses on one planar gradiometer pair of the publicly available Wakeman and Henson (2015) data. The introduced function can extract from group data not only single-subject latencies, but also grand-average and jackknife latencies. Furthermore, it gives the choice between different approaches to automatically set baselines and anchor points for latency estimation, approaches that were partly developed by me and that capitalize on the informational richness of MEG/EEG data. Although the function comes with a wide range of customization parameters, the default parameters are set so that even beginners get reasonable results. Graphical depictions of latency estimates, baselines, and anchor points overlaid on individual averages further support learning, understanding and trouble-shooting. Once extracted, latency estimates can be submitted to any analysis also available for (averaged) RTs, including tests for mean differences, correlational approaches and cognitive modeling.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive method for assessing neurophysiological function that can be used to achieve this goal. EEG measures the electrical activity of large, synchronously firing populations of neurons in the brain with electrodes placed on the scalp. This unit outlines the basics of setting up an EEG experiment with human participants, including equipment, and a step-by-step guide to applying and preparing an electrode cap. Also included are support protocols for two event-related potential (ERP) paradigms, P50 suppression and mismatch negativity (MMN), which are measures of early sensory processing. These paradigms can be used to assess the integrity of early sensory processing in normal individuals and clinical populations, such as individuals with schizophrenia.},

This DSM-ICD approach embraces an Aristotelian view of mental disorders as largely discrete entities that are characterized by distinctive signs, symptoms, and natural histories. Over the past several years, however, a competing vision, namely, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative launched by the National Institute of Mental Health, has emerged in response to accumulating anomalies within the DSM-ICD system. In contrast to DSM-ICD, RDoC embraces a Galilean view of psychopathology as the product of dysfunctions in neural circuitry. RDoC appears to be a valuable endeavor that holds out the long-term promise of an alternative system of mental illness classification. We delineate three sets of pressing challenges – conceptual, methodological, and logistical/pragmatic – that must be addressed for RDoC to realize its scientific potential, and conclude with a call for further research, including investigation of a rapprochement between Aristotelian and Galilean approaches to psychiatric classification.},

There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the p-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, p-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on p-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low p-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the p-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay. We believe that addressing the p-value problem will increase the credibility of large sample IS research as well as provide more insights for readers.},

Seventy-six children aged 8.7 ± 1.1 years participated in this cross-sectional study. We assessed aerobic fitness using the 20-m endurance shuttle run test, muscular fitness (endurance, power) using a standard test battery, and motor ability (manual dexterity, ball skills, and static and dynamic balance) using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. A modified delayed match-to-sample test was used to assess VSWM and the P3 component of event-related potentials. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that greater aerobic fitness was associated with smaller coefficient of variation of reaction time (p = .008), greater muscular fitness was associated with higher response accuracy (p = .022), greater motor ability was associated with higher response accuracy (p {$<$} .001) and increased P3 mean amplitude (p {$<$} .001) after controlling for age. Furthermore, the positive associations of motor ability with response accuracy (p = .001) were independent of muscular fitness. The findings from this study provide new insight into the differential associations between health-related fitness domains and VSWM, highlighting the influence of motor ability on brain health and cognitive development during childhood.},

  abstract = {Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula—or “nonparanormal”—for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method’s theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.},

  abstract = {Based on an interactive road-crossing task, this study examined age-related effects on crossing decisions and whether or not age affects behavioral adjustments to the time gap. It also compared crossing-task decisions to previously observed estimation-task decisions [Lobjois, R., Cavallo, V., 2007. Age-related differences in street-crossing decisions: the effects of vehicle speed and time constraints on gap selection in an estimation task. Accident Analysis and Prevention 39 (5), 934–943]. The results showed that older adults selected a greater mean time gap and initiated their crossing sooner than the younger ones, indicating an attempt to compensate for their increased crossing time. However, older adults accepted shorter and shorter time gaps as speed increased, putting them at a higher risk at high speeds. Regarding adaptive behavior, the analyses showed that all groups adjusted their crossing time to the available time. Comparison of crossing decisions and estimations revealed that the young group had a greater number of tight fits and missed fewer opportunities on the crossing task, whereas these differences did not appear in the elderly. This suggests that the crossing decisions of younger adults are much more finely tuned to time gaps in actual crossing tasks than in estimation tasks and that older adults have trouble calibrating perception and action and perceiving possibilities for action.},

Such concepts are multi-faceted in nature and have important practical implications in areas such as time management, financial planning, or medical choices. A large body of research has documented age-related limitations in global time horizons, but age differences in other aspects of temporal construal are comparatively poorly understood. The present article draws attention to developmental trajectories of self-continuity, defined as perceived associations of one’s present self with past and future selves. After considering historical roots and contemporary views on self-continuity, we turn to the life-span developmental literature and review several convergent streams of research that provide indirect evidence for age-related increases in self-continuity. We then consider a small body of recent studies which have directly assessed age differences in self-continuity and summarize our current understanding of this phenomenon including associations between explicit and implicit measures, symmetry between past and future self-continuity, and differentiation from other aspects of time perception. We conclude by highlighting open theoretical questions and considering the practical implications of an increased sense of self-continuity with advancing age.},

The richness of these datasets can be very useful in testing sophisticated hypotheses, but this richness also creates many opportunities to obtain effects that are statistically significant but do not reflect true differences among groups or conditions (bogus effects). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how common and seemingly innocuous methods for quantifying and analyzing ERP effects can lead to very high rates of significant but bogus effects, with the likelihood of obtaining at least one such bogus effect exceeding 50\% in many experiments. We focus on two specific problems: using the grand-averaged data to select the time windows and electrode sites for quantifying component amplitudes and latencies, and using one or more multifactor statistical analyses. Reanalyses of prior data and simulations of typical experimental designs are used to show how these problems can greatly increase the likelihood of significant but bogus results. Several strategies are described for avoiding these problems and for increasing the likelihood that significant effects actually reflect true differences among groups or conditions.},

Here, we propose a universal measure of data quality for ERP research—the standardized measurement error (SME)—which is a special case of the standard error of measurement. Whereas some existing metrics provide a generic quantification of the noise level, the SME quantifies the data quality (precision) for the specific amplitude or latency value being measured in a given study (e.g., the peak latency of the P3 wave). It can be applied to virtually any value that is derived from averaged ERP waveforms, making it a universal measure of data quality. In addition, the SME quantifies the data quality for each individual participant, making it possible to identify participants with low-quality data and “bad” channels. When appropriately aggregated across individuals, SME values can be used to quantify the combined impact of the single-trial EEG noise and the number of trials being averaged together on the effect size and statistical power in a given experiment. If SME values were regularly included in published articles, researchers could identify the recording and analysis procedures that produce the highest data quality, which could ultimately lead to increased effect sizes and greater replicability across the field.},

The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a psychological treatment program consisting of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) together with some behavioral seizure control technology shown to be successful in earlier research. Methods: The method consisted of a randomized controlled trial group design with repeated measures (n = 27). All participants had an EEG verified epilepsy diagnosis with drug refractory seizures. Participants were randomized into one of two conditions, ACT or supportive therapy (ST). Therapeutic effects were measured by examining changes in quality of life (SWLS and WHOQOL) and seizure index (frequency × duration). Both treatment conditions consisted of only nine hours of professional therapy distributed in two individual and two group sessions during a four-week period. Results: The results showed significant effects over all of the dependent variables for the ACT group as compared to the ST group at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that a short-term psychotherapy program combined with anticonvulsant drugs may help to prevent the long-term disability that occurs from drug refractory seizures.},

With the advent of modern neuroimaging technologies, opportunities exist for direct study of the mind’s machinery: the brain. Moreover, there are opportunities for applying these technologies to solve a host of educational and engineering challenges, such as how to design better interfaces with computer systems or how to better educate and train students. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a direct reflection of the functioning brain, and technologies that enable recording of the EEG have been in existence for more than 50 years. Within the past decade substantial progress has been made in EEG technology, permitting a direct view into the brain. We cover these advances in this paper, which include dense-sensor array technology and physics-based computational head models, and present several examples of how they have been applied.},

  abstract = {Learning novel sequences constitutes an example of declarative memory formation, involving conscious recall of temporal events. Performance in sequence learning tasks improves with repetition and involves forming temporal associations over scales of seconds to minutes. To further understand the neural circuits underlying declarative sequence learning over trials, we tracked changes in intracranial field potentials (IFPs) recorded from 1142 electrodes implanted throughout temporal and frontal cortical areas in 14 human subjects, while they learned the temporal-order of multiple sequences of images over trials through repeated recall. We observed an increase in power in the gamma frequency band (30–100 Hz) in the recall phase, particularly in areas within the temporal lobe including the parahippocampal gyrus. The degree of this gamma power enhancement decreased over trials with improved sequence recall. Modulation of gamma power was directly correlated with the improvement in recall performance. When presenting new sequences, gamma power was reset to high values and decreased again after learning. These observations suggest that signals in the gamma frequency band may play a more prominent role during the early steps of the learning process rather than during the maintenance of memory traces.},

  abstract = {Objective.Students with severe learning disabilities often show signs of anxiety, depression, and problem behaviors such as inattention and conduct problems. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in school settings constitute a promising option to alleviate these co-occurring symptoms. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the impact of an MBI on symptoms and behaviors of elementary school students with severe learning disabilities.Method.A one-group pretest-posttest design was used. The sample comprised 14 students aged 9 to 12 years with special education needs. Both student-report and teacher-report of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition were used.Results.Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed a significant impact of the MBI on symptoms and behaviors such as anxiety, depression, inattention, aggression, and conduct problems. Effect sizes for all variables were considered large (partial ?2 = .31-.61).Conclusion.These preliminary results indicate that MBIs can reduce the frequency of symptoms and problem behaviors often found in children with learning disabilities in elementary schools. Further multiple baseline experimental trials with a long-term follow-up are warranted to establish more robustly the effect of MBIs for children with learning disabilities.},

  abstract = {Personality traits are stable predictors of many life outcomes that are associated with important decisions that involve tradeoffs over time. Therefore, a fundamental question is how tradeoffs over time vary from person to person in relation to stable personality traits. We investigated the influence of personality, as measured by the Five-Factor Model, on time preferences and on neural activity engaged by intertemporal choice. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants made choices between smaller-sooner and larger-later monetary rewards. For each participant, we estimated a constant-sensitivity discount function that dissociates impatience (devaluation of future consequences) from time sensitivity (consistency with rational, exponential discounting). Overall, higher neuroticism was associated with a relatively greater preference for immediate rewards and higher conscientiousness with a relatively greater preference for delayed rewards. Specifically, higher conscientiousness correlated positively with lower short-term impatience and more exponential time preferences, whereas higher neuroticism (lower emotional stability) correlated positively with higher short-term impatience and less exponential time preferences. Cognitive-control and reward brain regions were more activated when higher conscientiousness participants selected a smaller-sooner reward and, conversely, when higher neuroticism participants selected a larger-later reward. The greater activations that occurred when choosing rewards that contradicted personality predispositions may reflect the greater recruitment of mental resources needed to override those predispositions. These findings reveal that stable personality traits fundamentally influence how rewards are chosen over time.},

  abstract = {The transdiagnostic approach states that there are key cognitive and behavioral processes responsible for maintaining symptoms and these are shared across psychological disorders (Harvey, Watkins, Mansell, \& Shafran, 2004). The first goal of this article is to justify the potential utility of a transdiagnostic perspective for theory, research and treatment using empirical evidence and clinical vignettes. We then take as an example one set of cognitive processes—attentional processes—to illustrate the approach. Evidence for three attentional processes is provided: vigilance to external concern–related stimuli; vigilance to internal concern–related stimuli (self–focused attention) and attentional avoidance. It is concluded that each of these attentional processes are transdiagnostic. We then discuss three possible resolutions to the question: How can a transdiagnostic perspective be valid when the different psychological disorders present so differently? The three proposals are: (1) variations in idiosyncratic current concerns; (2) variations in the degree of shared processes and (3) distinct processes for specific disorders or groups of disorders. The role of a transdiagnostic approach in supporting the development and testing of theories of psychopathology is highlighted and the need for future studies that incorporate multiple patient groups is discussed.},

Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Advances in brain research have invigorated an ongoing debate about the relations between psychology and neuroscience. Cognitive science has historically neglected the study of neuroscience, although the influential subfield of cognitive neuroscience has since attempted to combine information processing approaches with an awareness of brain functioning. Although cognitive neuroscience does not necessarily support a reductionist approach, certain philosophers of mind have suggested that psychological constructs will eventually be replaced with descriptions of neurobiological processes. One implicitly popular response to this proposal is that neuroscience represents a level of implementation that is separate from a level of cognition. Although recent work in the philosophy of mind has gone some way to explicating the concept of psychological and neuroscience approaches as different levels, it is suggested here that a tidy framework of levels is somewhat tenuous. A particular challenge comes from the metatheoretical position of embodiment, which places the mind within the body and brain of an active organism which is deeply embedded in the world. In providing an integration of brain, body, mind, and culture, embodiment exemplifies an important line of defense against claims of the possible reduction of psychology by neuroscience.},

  abstract = {The P300 component of the human event-related brain potential has often been linked to the processing of rare, surprising events. However, the formal computational processes underlying the generation of the P300 are not well known. Here, we formulate a simple model of trial-by-trial learning of stimulus probabilities based on Information Theory. Specifically, we modeled the surprise associated with the occurrence of a visual stimulus to provide a formal quantification of the “subjective probability” associated with an event. Subjects performed a choice reaction time task, while we recorded their brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG). In each of 12 blocks, the probabilities of stimulus occurrence were changed, thereby creating sequences of trials with low, medium, and high predictability. Trial-by-trial variations in the P300 component were best explained by a model of stimulus-bound surprise. This model accounted for the data better than a categorical model that parametrically encoded the stimulus identity, or an alternative model of surprise based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence. The present data demonstrate that trial-by-trial changes in P300 can be explained by predictions made by an ideal observer keeping track of the probabilities of possible events. This provides evidence for theories proposing a direct link between the P300 component and the processing of surprising events. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how model-based analyses can be used to explain significant proportions of the trial-by-trial changes in human event-related EEG responses.},

Method Data were collected on 316 college students at a midsized public university in the upper Midwest who reported using alcohol. Results Findings indicated that both negative affect and coping drinking motives moderated the alcohol use–alcohol problems relationship. The three-way interaction indicated that the strongest relationship between alcohol use and alcohol-related problems existed for individuals high in both negative affect and coping drinking motives. Conclusions This study suggests that college students high in negative affect and coping drinking motives are particularly at risk for experiencing problems as a result of their alcohol use, indicating that clinicians should consider screening for these factors when conducting alcohol-related prevention and intervention efforts.},

In its most general form, the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis states that “activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is induced at appropriate synapses during memory formation and is both necessary and sufficient for the information storage underlying the type of memory mediated by the brain area in which that plasticity is observed.” We outline a set of criteria by which this hypothesis can be judged and describe a range of experimental strategies used to investigate it. We review both classical and newly discovered properties of synaptic plasticity and stress the importance of the neural architecture and synaptic learning rules of the network in which it is embedded. The greater part of the article focuses on types of memory mediated by the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. We conclude that a wealth of data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity is necessary for learning and memory, but that little data currently supports the notion of sufficiency.},

A learning disability (LD) was present in 70\% of the children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with a learning disability in written expression two times more common (65\%) than a learning disability in reading, math, or spelling. Children with LD and ADHD had more severe learning problems than children who had LD but no ADHD, and the former also had more severe attention problems than children who had ADHD but no LD. Further, children with ADHD but no LD had some degree of learning problem, and children with LD but no ADHD had some degree of attention problem.

We computed three types of networks: (a) Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) depicting regularized partial correlations, (b) regression-based GGMs depicting nonregularized partial correlations, and (c) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) via a Bayesian hill-climbing algorithm. Low energy and elevated energy were consistently identified as central nodes in the GGMs and as key parent nodes in the DAGs. Across analyses, pessimism about the future and depressed mood were the symptoms most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behavior. These exploratory analyses provide rich information about how bipolar disorder symptoms relate to one another, thereby furnishing a foundation for investigating how bipolar disorder symptoms may operate as a causal system.

In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching ½ of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by “success” is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. “Statistical significance” plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental “cuteness” and a free reliance upon               ad               hoc explanations to avoid refutation.},

Nonmetric two-dimensional MDS maps were selected for interpretation. The most cognitively complex subtests and indexes were located near the center of the maps. Subtests were also grouped together in the way that they are organized in the primary and complementary indexes, and not necessarily on content surface features. Naming Speed and Symbol Translation scores may be better off kept as separate indexes, and Digit Span Sequencing appeared to add more complexity to the Digit Span subtest. One implication related to score interpretation is that General Ability Index (GAI) and Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI) may be distinguished by the level of complexity of the subtests included in each index (i.e., more complex subtests included in GAI and less complex subtests included in the CPI).},

  abstract = {The development of treatment biomarkers for psychiatric disorders has been challenging, particularly for heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Promising findings are also rarely translated into clinical practice, especially with regard to treatment decisions and development of novel treatments. Despite this slow progress, the available neuroimaging, electrophysiological (EEG) and genetic literature provides a solid foundation for biomarker discovery. This article gives an updated review of promising treatment biomarkers for ADHD which may enhance personalized medicine and novel treatment development. The available literature points to promising pre-treatment profiles predicting efficacy of various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD. These candidate predictive biomarkers, particularly those based on low-cost and non-invasive EEG assessments, show promise for the future stratification of patients to specific treatments. Studies with repeated biomarker assessments further show that different treatments produce distinct changes in brain profiles, which track treatment-related clinical improvements. These candidate monitoring/response biomarkers may aid future monitoring of treatment effects and point to mechanistic targets for novel treatments, such as neurotherapies. Nevertheless, existing research does not support any immediate clinical applications of treatment biomarkers for ADHD. Key barriers are the paucity of replications and external validations, the use of small and homogeneous samples of predominantly White children, and practical limitations, including the cost and technical requirements of biomarker assessments and their unknown feasibility and acceptability for people with ADHD. We conclude with a discussion of future directions and methodological changes to promote clinical translation and enhance personalized treatment decisions for diverse groups of individuals with ADHD.},

In this regard, a broad palette of techniques, ranging from behavioural testing to brain imaging, is available for the exploration of innovative concepts and the characterization of new drugs.Despite the key importance of pharmacotherapy, the relevance of alternative strategies should not be neglected. The association of both approaches may emerge to be particularly effective for realizing the goal of enhanced cognitive performance and, accordingly, improved quality of life in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {A fundamental task in neuroscience is to characterize the brain's developmental course. While replicable group-level models of structural brain development from childhood to adulthood have recently been identified, we have yet to quantify and understand individual differences in structural brain development. The present study examined inter-individual variability and sex differences in changes in brain structure, as assessed by anatomical MRI, across ages 8.0–26.0 years in 269 participants (149 females) with three time points of data (807 scans), drawn from three longitudinal datasets collected in the Netherlands, Norway, and USA. We further investigated the relationship between overall brain size and developmental changes, as well as how females and males differed in change variability across development. There was considerable inter-individual variability in the magnitude of changes observed for all examined brain measures. The majority of individuals demonstrated decreases in total gray matter volume, cortex volume, mean cortical thickness, and white matter surface area in mid-adolescence, with more variability present during the transition into adolescence and the transition into early adulthood. While most individuals demonstrated increases in white matter volume in early adolescence, this shifted to a majority demonstrating stability starting in mid-to-late adolescence. We observed sex differences in these patterns, and also an association between the size of an individual's brain structure and the overall rate of change for the structure. The present study provides new insight as to the amount of individual variance in changes in structural morphometrics from late childhood to early adulthood in order to obtain a more nuanced picture of brain development. The observed individual- and sex-differences in brain changes also highlight the importance of further studying individual variation in developmental patterns in healthy, at-risk, and clinical populations.},

This research helped inform and structure our neuropsychologically based model of the “elements” of attention. The model has been used to assess attention in the research laboratory and clinic, and has led to a “nosology of disorders of attention,” which is presented here in preliminary form. The nosology reviews the possible causes of the symptom(s) of impaired attention, as well as suggesting a blueprint for future research in this area.},

Because of their radically different scopes and emphases, however, comparing different models and theories and understanding how they relate to one another has been a difficult task. This volume offers a much-needed forum for systematically comparing and contrasting existing models of working memory. It does so by asking each contributor to address the same comprehensive set of important theoretical questions on working memory. The answers to these questions provided in the volume elucidate the emerging general consensus on the nature of working memory among different theorists and crystallize incompatible theoretical claims that must be resolved in future research. As such, this volume serves not only as a milestone that documents the state-of-the-art in the field but also as a theoretical guidebook that will likely promote new lines of research and more precise and comprehensive models of working memory.},

In 9 children, age 9–13 years, a positive peak was clearly identified in approximately a quarter of the processed single sweep responses to target stimuli (single sweep P300), whereas it was observed less frequently for non-target stimuli. In 2 children of age 6 years, it was difficult to discriminate single sweep P300 from background EEG activities even in the processed data. As for the former group, the detection ratio of P300 in single sweep target responses ranged from 10.0 to 40.0\%, and its mean latency and amplitude ranged from 311 to 348 ms and from 31.7 to 41.5 μV, respectively. There was a significant correlation between average data and single sweep data in terms of the P300 latency. However, the amplitude of P300 in the average data bore no relation to the detection ratio, mean amplitude or variability of latency among single sweep P300s. As compared with adult data previously reported, the detection ratio of single sweep P300 was lower and the P300 amplitude was higher in childhood. P300 in children, at least past puberty, can be analyzed by using the single trial method, which is expected to provide more information about the development of human higher brain functions, especially cognitive function.},

However, it has been demonstrated that some changes with time on task are not only related to mental fatigue. The present study intends to clarify these effects of time on task unrelated to mental fatigue on response selection processes at the behavioural and electrophysiological level (using event-related potentials, ERPs). Participants had to perform a Simon task for more than 3\,hours and rated their experienced mental fatigue and motivation to continue with the task at several time points during the experiment. The results show that at the beginning of the experiment some unspecific modulations of training and adaptation are evident. With time on task participants’ ability to resolve response conflict appears to become impaired. The results reveal that time on task effects cannot be completely explained by mental fatigue. Instead, it seems that an interplay of adaptation at the beginning and motivational effects in the course of a task modulate performance and neurophysiological parameters. In future studies it will be important to account for the relative contribution of adaptation and motivation parameters when time on task effects are investigated.},

  abstract = {Recent EEG studies have shown that implicit learning involving specific cortical circuits results in an enduring local trace manifested as local changes in spectral power. Here we used a well characterized visual sequence learning task and high density-(hd-)EEG recording to determine whether also declarative learning leaves a post-task, local change in the resting state oscillatory activity in the areas involved in the learning process. Thus, we recorded hd-EEG in normal subjects before, during and after the acquisition of the order of a fixed spatial target sequence (VSEQ) and during the presentation of targets in random order (VRAN). We first determined the temporal evolution of spectral changes during VSEQ and compared it to VRAN. We found significant differences in the alpha and theta bands in three main scalp regions, a right occipito-parietal (ROP), an anterior-frontal (AFr), and a right frontal (RFr) area. The changes in frontal theta power during VSEQ were positively correlated with the learning rate. Further, post-learning EEG recordings during resting state revealed a significant increase in alpha power in ROP relative to a pre-learning baseline. We conclude that declarative learning is associated with alpha and theta changes in frontal and posterior regions that occur during the task, and with an increase of alpha power in the occipito-parietal region after the task. These post-task changes may represent a trace of learning and a hallmark of use-dependent plasticity.},

  abstract = {In this brief review, we describe current computational models of drug-use and addiction that fall into 2 broad categories: mathematically based models that rely on computational theories, and brain-based models that link computations to brain areas or circuits. Across categories, many are models of learning and decision-making, which may be compromised in addiction. Several mathematical models take predictive coding approaches, focusing on Bayesian prediction error. Other models focus on learning processes and (traditional) prediction error. Brain-based models have incorporated prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and the dopamine system, based on the effects of drugs on dopamine, motivation, and executive control circuits. Several models specifically describe how behavioral control may transition from habitual to goal-directed systems, consistent with computational accounts of compromised 'model-based' control. Some brain-based models have linked this to the transition of behavioral control from ventral to dorsal striatum. Overall, we propose that while computational models capture some aspects of addiction and have advanced our thinking, most have focused on the effects of drug use rather than addiction per se, most have not been tested on and/or supported by human data, and few capture multiple stages and symptoms of addiction. We conclude by suggesting a path forward for computational models of addiction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, empirical evidence on comorbidity rates including all three learning disorders as defined by DSM-5 (deficits in reading, writing, and mathematics) is scarce. The current study assessed prevalence rates and gender ratios for isolated as well as comorbid learning disorders in a representative sample of 1633 German speaking children in 3rd and 4th Grade. Prevalence rates were analysed for isolated as well as combined learning disorders and for different deficit criteria, including a criterion for normal performance. Comorbid learning disorders occurred as frequently as isolated learning disorders, even when stricter cutoff criteria were applied. The relative proportion of isolated and combined disorders did not change when including a criterion for normal performance. Reading and spelling deficits differed with respect to their association with arithmetic problems: Deficits in arithmetic co-occurred more often with deficits in spelling than with deficits in reading. In addition, comorbidity rates for arithmetic and reading decreased when applying stricter deficit criteria, but stayed high for arithmetic and spelling irrespective of the chosen deficit criterion. These findings suggest that the processes underlying the relationship between arithmetic and reading might differ from those underlying the relationship between arithmetic and spelling. With respect to gender ratios, more boys than girls showed spelling deficits, while more girls were impaired in arithmetic. No gender differences were observed for isolated reading problems and for the combination of all three learning disorders. Implications of these findings for assessment and intervention of learning disorders are discussed.},

Gross (1998b) conceptualized the timing of regulation strategies as key to this relationship, with response-focused strategies, such as expressive suppression, as less effective and more detrimental compared to antecedent-focused ones, such as cognitive reappraisal. In the current study, we examined the relationship between reappraisal and expressive suppression and measures of psychopathology, particularly for stress-related reactions, in both undergraduate and trauma-exposed community samples of women. Generally, expressive suppression was associated with higher, and reappraisal with lower, self-reported stress-related symptoms. In particular, expressive suppression was associated with PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms in the trauma-exposed community sample, with rumination partially mediating this association. Finally, based on factor analysis, expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal appear to be independent constructs. Overall, expressive suppression, much more so than cognitive reappraisal, may play an important role in the experience of stress-related symptoms. Further, given their independence, there are potentially relevant clinical implications, as interventions that shift one of these emotion regulation strategies may not lead to changes in the other.},

  abstract = {EEG provides a rich measure of brain activity that can be characterized as neuronal oscillations. However, most developmental EEG work to date has focused on analyzing EEG data as Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) or power based on the Fourier transform. While these measures have been productive, they do not leverage all the information contained within the EEG signal. Namely, ERP analyses ignore non-phase-locked signals and Fourier-based power analyses ignore temporal information. Time-frequency analyses can better characterize the oscillations contained in the EEG data. By separating power and phase information across different frequencies, time-frequency measures provide a closer interpretation of the neurophysiological mechanisms, facilitate translation across neurophysiology disciplines, and capture processes not observed by ERP or Fourier-based analyses (e.g., connectivity). Despite their unique contributions, a literature review of this journal reveals that time-frequency analyses of EEG are yet to be embraced by the developmental cognitive neuroscience field. This manuscript presents a conceptual introduction to time-frequency analyses for developmental researchers. To facilitate the use of time-frequency analyses, we include a tutorial of accessible scripts, based on Cohen (2014), to calculate time-frequency power (signal strength), inter-trial phase synchrony (signal consistency), and two types of phase-based connectivity (inter-channel phase synchrony and weighted phase lag index).},

There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

  abstract = {Cross-sectional group comparisons have shown altered neurocognitive and neurophysiological profiles in in­ dividuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We report a two-year longitudinal observational study of ADHD children and adolescents (N = 239) regarding ADHD symptoms, behavioral metrics, and event-related potentials (ERP) and compared them to healthy controls (N = 91). The participants were assessed up to five times with a cued Go/NoGo task while ERPs were recorded. We fitted the trajectories of our variables of interest with univariate and bivariate latent growth curve models. At baseline, the ADHD group had increased reaction time variability, higher number of omission and com­ mission errors, and attenuated CNV and P3d amplitudes compared to controls. The task performance in terms of behavioral metrics improved in both groups over two years; however, with differential patterns: the decrease in reaction time and omission errors were stronger in the control group, and the reduction of commission errors was more substantial in the ADHD group.},

  abstract = {Working memory (WM) dysfunction and increased within-subject variability are known issues in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients. Little is known about the electrophysiological characteristics of this variability. We evaluated behavioral and electrophysiological within-subject variability taking developmental aspects into account in a group of ADHD patients. Multichannel (n~=~31) event-related potentials (ERP) were measured during a visuo-spatial backmatching task; 44 children (8–16~years old) were tested: 22 children with ADHD, combined (n~=~17) and inattentive (n~=~5) type, and 22 age- and intelligence-matched control children. One-backmatching (BM1) and two-backmatching (BM2) tasks were performed. Classical behavioral parameters and target and nontarget ERP were compared between groups. In addition, motor response variability and ERP amplitude variability were studied. Age-related changes in both motor response and ERP amplitude variability were analyzed in each group. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder children made more commission errors, which was more pronounced in the difficult (BM2) task. No difference between groups was found in ERP amplitude and in motor response variability. However, ADHD patients had higher ERP amplitude variability, which was again more pronounced in the difficult WM task. A delayed maturation of amplitude variability was seen in ADHD patients with a slower than in controls decrease in variability with age. This amplitude variability was correlated with the number of commissions, but in an opposite way for ADHD and control children. Our findings indicate an impaired visuo-spatial WM processing in ADHD children with greater ERP amplitude variability compared to controls. Our results also support the view of a delayed cortical development of visuo-spatial WM circuits in this disorder.},

In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientific perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are known to be systematically wrong? How might “toy problems” tell a misleading story? How does the scientific goal of explanation align with (or differ from) traditional statistical concerns? I do not offer answers to these questions, but hope to highlight the reasons why psychological researchers cannot avoid asking them.},

  abstract = {Background Depression is associated with cognitive deficits across multiple domains, including working memory. The n-back task, a convenient psychometric tool capable of computerised delivery and concurrent use with neuroimaging, can provide enhanced insight into working memory dysfunction in depression. This meta-analysis sought to investigate the n-back task under varying cognitive load conditions (i.e. different levels of ‘n’) to clarify the pattern of working memory deficits in depression. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies involving unipolar depressed participants and matched controls utilising the n-back task. Meta-analyses were performed for accuracy and response times at four levels of cognitive load (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). Results 31 studies (total 1,666 participants) met inclusion criteria and were included for quantitative analyses. Depressed individuals had significantly reduced accuracy compared to controls for 1-, 2-, and 3-back tasks, but not the attentional 0-back task. Likewise, response latencies were prolonged for all task levels (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). Additional meta-regression analyses indicated that participant age and clinical status (i.e. inpatient/outpatient) may exacerbate working memory deficits associated with depression. Limitations Our results indicate high levels of heterogeneity between studies, particularly for response times. Conclusions Accuracy impairments were worse at higher levels of n, with the largest effect size obtained on the 2-back task, suggesting deficits to higher executive functions. Response times were consistently prolonged at all cognitive loads in agreement with a pattern of generalised psychomotor retardation.},

  abstract = {Electrophysiological markers of chunking of words during encoding have mostly been shown in studies that present pairs of related stimuli. In these cases it is difficult to disentangle cognitive processes that reflect distinctiveness (i.e., conspicuous items because they are related), perceived association between related items and unified representations of various items, or chunking. Here, we propose a paradigm that enables the determination of a separate Event-related Potential (ERP) marker of these cognitive processes using sequentially related word triads. Twenty-three young healthy individuals viewed 80 15-word lists composed of unrelated items except for the three words in the middle serial positions (triads), which could be either unrelated (control list), related perceptually, phonetically or semantically. ERP amplitudes were measured at encoding of each one of the words in the triads. We analyzed two latency intervals (350–400 and 400–800 ms) at midline locations. Behaviorally, we observed a progressive facilitation in the immediate free recall of the words in the triads depending on the relations between their items (control {$<$} perceptual {$<$} phonetic {$<$} semantic), but only semantically related items were recalled as chunks. P300-like deflections were observed for perceptually deviant stimuli. A reduction of amplitude of a component akin to the N400 was found for words that were phonetically and semantically associated with prior items and therefore were not associated to chunking. Positive slow wave (PSW) amplitudes increased as successive phonetically and semantically related items were presented, but they were observed earlier and were more prominent at Fz for semantic associates. PSWs at Fz and Cz also correlated with recall of semantic word chunks. This confirms prior claims that PSWs at Fz are potential markers of chunking which, in the proposed paradigm, were modulated differently from the detection of deviant stimuli and of relations between stimuli.},

  abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

Fitting response time and accuracy to a drift-diffusion model produces evidence accumulation rate and non-decision time parameter estimates that reflect cognitive processes. Our goal is to elucidate the effect of attention on visual decision making. In this study, we show that measures of attention obtained from simultaneous EEG recordings can explain per-trial evidence accumulation rates and perceptual preprocessing times during a visual decision making task. Models assuming linear relationships between diffusion model parameters and EEG measures as external inputs were fit in a single step in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The EEG measures were features of the evoked potential (EP) to the onset of a masking noise and the onset of a task-relevant signal stimulus. Single-trial evoked EEG responses, P200s to the onsets of visual noise and N200s to the onsets of visual signal, explain single-trial evidence accumulation and preprocessing times. Within-trial evidence accumulation variance was not found to be influenced by attention to the signal or noise. Single-trial measures of attention lead to better out-of-sample predictions of accuracy and correct reaction time distributions for individual subjects.},

Diagnoses of the causes of this “replication crisis,” and recommendations to address it, have nearly exclusively focused on methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. We propose a distinction between discovery-oriented and theory-testing research. In discovery-oriented research, theories do not strongly imply hypotheses by which they can be tested, but rather define a search space for the discovery of effects that would support them. Failures to find these effects do not question the theory. This endeavor necessarily engenders a high risk of Type I errors—that is, publication of findings that will not replicate. Theory-testing research, by contrast, relies on theories that strongly imply hypotheses, such that disconfirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence against the theory. Theory-testing research engenders a smaller risk of Type I errors. A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models. We critically revisit recommendations for addressing the “replication crisis,” including the proposal to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory research, and the preregistration of hypotheses and analysis plans.},

It is currently unrealistic to expect a theory to explain them all; theorists must satisfice with explaining a subset of findings. The aim of the present article is to make the choice of that subset less arbitrary and idiosyncratic than is current practice. We propose criteria for identifying benchmark findings that every theory in a field should be able to explain: Benchmarks should be reproducible, generalize across materials and methodological variations, and be theoretically informative. We propose a set of benchmarks for theories and computational models of short-term and working memory. The benchmarks are described in as theory-neutral a way as possible, so that they can serve as empirical common ground for competing theoretical approaches. Benchmarks are rated on three levels according to their priority for explanation. Selection and ratings of the benchmarks is based on consensus among the authors, who jointly represent a broad range of theoretical perspectives on working memory, and they are supported by a survey among other experts on working memory. The article is accompanied by a web page providing an open forum for discussion; a site for submitting proposals for new benchmarks; and a repository for reference data sets for each benchmark.},

The chapter proposes an architecture for a system that meets these requirements. The working memory system consists of a declarative and a procedural part, each of which has three embedded components: the activated part of long-term memory, a component for creating new structural representations by dynamic bindings (the ‘‘region of direct access’’ for declarative working memory, and the ‘‘bridge’’ for procedural working memory), and a mechanism for selecting a single element (‘‘focus of attention’’ for declarative working memory, and ‘‘response focus’’ for procedural working memory). The architecture affords two modes of information processing, an analytical and an associative mode. This distinction provides a theoretically founded formulation of a dual-process theory of reasoning.},

The present experiment orthogonally varies retention interval (0 or 9 s) and whether the list is to be recalled after the retention interval. Hebb repetition learning is assessed in a final test phase. A repetition effect was obtained in all four experimental conditions; it was larger for recalled than non-recalled lists, whereas retention interval had no effect. The results show that encoding is sufficient to generate cumulative long-term learning, which is strengthened by recall. Rehearsal, if it takes place in the retention interval at all, does not have the same effect on long-term learning as overt recall.},

We show in four experiments that the Hebb repetition effect is also observed with a complex-span task, in which encoding or retrieval of list items alternates with an unrelated processing task. The interruption of encoding or retrieval by the processing task did not reduce the size of the Hebb effect, demonstrating that incidental long-term learning forms integrated representations of lists, excluding the interleaved processing events. Contrary to the assumption that complex-span performance relies more on long-term memory than standard immediate serial recall (simple span), the Hebb effect was not larger in complex-span than in simple-span performance. The Hebb effect in complex span was also not modulated by the opportunity for refreshing list items, questioning a role of refreshing for the acquisition of the long-term memory representations underlying the effect.},

We examine the possibility that capacity limitations arise from temporal decay; we examine whether they might reflect a limitation in cognitive resources; and we ask whether capacity might be limited because of mutual interference of representations in WM. We evaluate each hypothesis against a common set of findings reflecting the capacity limit: The set-size effect and its modulation by domain-specificity and heterogeneity of the memory set; the effects of unfilled retention intervals and of distractor processing in the retention interval; and the pattern of correlates of WM tests. We conclude that—at least for verbal memoranda—a decay explanation is untenable. A resource-based view remains tenable but has difficulty accommodating several findings. The interference approach has its own set of difficulties but accounts best for the set of findings, and therefore, appears to present the most promising approach for future development.},

  abstract = {There is broad agreement that working memory is closely related to attention. This article delineates several theoretical options for conceptualizing this link, and evaluates their viability in light of their theoretical implications and the empirical support they received. A first divide exists between the concept of attention as a limited resource, and the concept of attention as selective information processing. Theories conceptualizing attention as a resource assume that this resource is responsible for the limited capacity of working memory. Three versions of this idea have been proposed: Attention as a resource for storage and processing, a shared resource for perceptual attention and memory maintenance, and a resource for the control of attention. The first of these three is empirically well supported, but the other two are not. By contrast, when attention is understood as a selection mechanism, it is usually not invoked to explain the capacity limit of working memory – rather, researchers ask how different forms of attention interact with working memory, in two areas. The first pertains to attentional selection of the contents of working memory, controlled by mechanisms of filtering out irrelevant stimuli, and removing no-longer relevant representations from working memory. Within working memory contents, a single item is often selected into the focus of attention for processing. The second area pertains to the role of working memory in cognitive control. Working memory contributes to controlling perceptual attention – by holding templates for targets of perceptual selection – and controlling action – by holding task sets to implement our current goals.},

  abstract = {Accessible summary Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex disorder that is difficult to treat. Five psychotherapeutic approaches are used in the management of BPD. These include cognitive behavioural therapy, mentalization-based therapy, schema-focused therapy, transference-focused therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Of the five approaches used to manage BPD, DBT has been studied the most extensively. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a multi-pronged approach comprising of skills-based training, individual psychotherapy, telephone calls and consultation team meetings. DBT can have a positive effect on therapists, shifting therapeutic pessimism towards one of optimism with DBT therapists also describing personal changes resulting from their work with clients. A considerable number of trials have been conducted as DBT was developed in the early 1990s, and most support the usefulness of BPD in the treatment of BPD. However, two Cochrane reviews conclude that more research is needed to provide stronger evidence in support of DBT for the management of BPD. Abstract Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex disorder that is difficult to treat. However, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan in the early 1990s, has emerged as a promising treatment option for those diagnosed with BPD. DBT is a multi-pronged treatment approach delivered normally in outpatient settings over 12 months and requires highly skilled and trained therapists. Many trials have provided evidence to support the use of DBT in the treatment of BPD. However, outcome measures vary and are mostly limited to measurable behavioural outcomes such as incidences of deliberate self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Two recent Cochrane reviews conclude that DBT does benefit those with BPD, but more robust evidence is needed. DBT training for health care professionals also has the potential to shift health care professionals' attitudes from one of therapeutic pessimism to one of optimism.},

With the increasing availability of large data sets in psychology, the “crud” factor has, however, become more relevant than ever before. When referenced in empirical work, it is often used by researchers to discount minute—but statistically significant—effects that are deemed too small to be considered meaningful. This review tracks the history of the crud factor and examines how its use in the psychological- and behavioral-science literature has developed to this day. We highlight a common and deep-seated lack of understanding about what the crud factor is and discuss whether it can be proven to exist or estimated and how it should be interpreted. This lack of understanding makes the crud factor a convenient tool for psychologists to use to disregard unwanted results, even though the presence of a crud factor should be a large inconvenience for the discipline. To inspire a concerted effort to take the crud factor more seriously, we clarify the definitions of important concepts, highlight current pitfalls, and pose questions that need to be addressed to ultimately improve understanding of the crud factor. Such work will be necessary to develop the crud factor into a useful concept encouraging improved psychological research.},

Here, we review models of the higher level aspects of human intelligence, which depend critically on the prefrontal cortex and associated subcortical areas. The picture emerging from a convergence of detailed mechanistic models and more abstract functional models represents a synthesis between analog and digital forms of computation. Specifically, the need for robust active maintenance and rapid updating of information in the prefrontal cortex appears to be satisfied by bistable activation states and dynamic gating mechanisms. These mechanisms are fundamental to digital computers and may be critical for the distinctive aspects of human intelligence.},

  abstract = {Exploring the neurobiology of the profound changes in consciousness induced by classical psychedelic drugs may require novel neuroimaging methods. Serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin produce states of increased sensory-emotional awareness and arousal, accompanied by increased spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity. By directly stimulating cortical tissue, the altered dynamics and propagation of the evoked EEG activity can reveal drug-induced changes in the overall brain state. We combine Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and EEG to reveal that psilocybin produces a state of increased chaotic brain activity which is not a result of altered complexity in the underlying causal interactions between brain regions. We also map the regional effects of psilocybin on TMS-evoked activity and identify changes in frontal brain structures that may be associated with the phenomenology of psychedelic experiences.},

  abstract = {Long-term chronic alcoholism is associated with disparate and widespread residual consequences for brain functioning and behavior, and alcoholics suffer a variety of cognitive deficiencies and emotional abnormalities. Alcoholism has heterogeneous origins and outcomes, depending upon factors such as family history, age, gender, and mental or physical health. Consequently, the neuropsychological profiles associated with alcoholism are not uniform among individuals. Moreover, within and across research studies, variability among participants is substantial and contributes to characteristics associated with differential treatment outcomes after detoxification. In order to refine our understanding of alcoholism-related impaired, spared, and recovered abilities, we focus on five specific functional domains: (1) memory, (2) executive functions, (3) emotion and psychosocial skills, (4) visuospatial cognition, and (5) psychomotor abilities. The brain systems that are most vulnerable to alcoholism are the frontocerebellar and mesocorticolimbic circuitries. Over time, with abstinence from alcohol, the brain appears to become reorganized to provide compensation for structural and behavioral deficits. By relying on a combination of clinical and scientific approaches, future research will help to refine the compensatory roles of healthy brain systems, the degree to which abstinence and treatment facilitate the reversal of brain atrophy and dysfunction, and the importance of individual differences to outcome.},

In this article, I instead argue that formal modelling cannot solve the core problem the psychological ‘theory crisis’ refers to, which are the currently high degrees of contrastive and holistic underdetermination of our theories by our data. I do so by first introducing underdetermination as an explanatory framework for determining the evidential import of research findings for theories, and showing how both broader theoretical considerations and informal assumptions are key to this process. Then, I derive the aforementioned core problem from the current ‘theory crisis’ literature and tentatively explore its possible solutions. Lastly, I show that formal modelling is neither a necessary nor sufficient solution for either contrastive or holistic underdetermination, and that its uncritical adoption might instead worsen the crisis.},

  abstract = {The intra-subject variability (ISV) in brain responses during cognitive processing across experimental trials has been recognised as an important facet of neural functionality reflecting an intrinsic neurophysiological characteristic of the brain. In recent decades, ISV in behaviour has been found to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning varying across individuals, development, ages, and pathological conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) measured in single trials are important tools for characterizing ISV at the neural level. However, due to the overlapping spectra of noise and signals, the retrieval of information from single-trial ERPs related to cognitive processing has been a challenge. We review the major problems that researchers face in the estimation of ISV in single-trial ERPs. Then, we present an extensive evaluation of several methods of single-trial latency estimation based on both simulated and real data. The relationships of ISV in ERPs and reaction times are compared between the different single-trial methods to assess their relative efficiency in predicting task performance from neural signals. The pros and cons of the methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {According to cognitive load theory (CLT), the limitations of working memory (WM) in the learning of new tasks together with its ability to cooperate with an unlimited long-term memory (LTM) for familiar tasks enable human beings to deal effectively with complex problems and acquire highly complex knowledge and skills. With regard to WM, CLT has focused to a large extent on learning task characteristics, and to a lesser extent on learner characteristics to manage WM load and optimize learning through instructional design. With regard to LTM, explanations of human learning and cognition have mainly focused on domain-general skills, instead of domain-specific knowledge held in LTM. The contributions to this special issue provide a broader cognitive load view on the role of memory in learning and education by presenting the historical roots and conceptual development of the concept of WM, as well as the theoretical and practical implications of current debates about WM mechanisms (Cowan 2014), by presenting an updated model of cognitive load in which the physical learning environment is considered a distinct causal factor for WM load (Choi et al. 2014), by an experimental demonstration of the effects of persistent pain on the available WM resources for learning (Smith and Ayres 2014), and by using aspects of evolutionary educational psychology to argue for the primacy of domain-specific knowledge in human cognition (Tricot and Sweller 2014).},

  abstract = {A growing synergy between the fields of cognitive neuroscience and mathematical psychology has sparked the development of several unique statistical approaches exploiting the benefits of both disciplines (Turner, Forstmann et~al., 2017). One approach in particular, called joint modeling, attempts to model the covariation between the parameters of “submodels” intended to capture important patterns in each stream of data. Joint models present an interesting opportunity to transcend conventional levels of analyses (e.g., Marr’s hierarchy; Marr, 1982) by providing fully integrative models (Love, 2015). In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial of two flavors of joint models —~the Directed and Covariance approaches. Computational procedures have been developed to apply these approaches to a number of cognitive tasks, yet neither have been made accessible to a wider audience. Here, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to develop submodels of each stream of data, as well as how to link the important model parameters to form one cohesive model. For convenience, we provide code that uses the Just Another Gibbs Sampler (Plummer, 2003) software to perform estimation of the model parameters. We close with a demonstration of the approach applied to actual data from a contrast discrimination task where activation parameters of early visual areas are directly mapped to the drift rate parameter in a simplified version of the diffusion decision model (Ratcliff, 1978).},

  abstract = {This special issue explores the growing intersection between mathematical psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Mathematical psychology, and cognitive modeling more generally, has a rich history of formalizing and testing hypotheses about cognitive mechanisms within a mathematical and computational language, making exquisite predictions of how people perceive, learn, remember, and decide. Cognitive neuroscience aims to identify neural mechanisms associated with key aspects of cognition using techniques like neurophysiology, electrophysiology, and structural and functional brain imaging. These two come together in a powerful new approach called model-based cognitive neuroscience, which can both inform cognitive modeling and help to interpret neural measures. Cognitive models decompose complex behavior into representations and processes and these latent model states can be used to explain the modulation of brain states under different experimental conditions. Reciprocally, neural measures provide data that help constrain cognitive models and adjudicate between competing cognitive models that make similar predictions about behavior. As examples, brain measures are related to cognitive model parameters fitted to individual participant data, measures of brain dynamics are related to measures of model dynamics, model parameters are constrained by neural measures, model parameters or model states are used in statistical analyses of neural data, or neural and behavioral data are analyzed jointly within a hierarchical modeling framework. We provide an introduction to the field of model-based cognitive neuroscience and to the articles contained within this special issue.},

DBT was not significantly different from TAU in reducing depression symptoms in three RCTs (pooled Hedges? g ?0.896).Discussion:DBT demonstrates efficacy in stabilizing and controlling self-destructive behavior and improving patient compliance.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Cognitive functioning in older age has a huge impact on quality of life and physical and mental health. Whilst most research in cognition in older age has focussed on mean levels, there is some evidence that individuals with cognitive functioning that varies a lot around this may have different risk factors and outcomes to those with less variable functioning. Existing approaches to investigate such intraindividual variability (IIV) typically involve deriving a summary statistic for each person from residual error around a fitted mean. However, such methods ignore sampling variability, prohibit the exploration of associations with time-varying factors, and are biased by floor and ceiling effects. To address this, we fitted a mixed-effects location scale beta-binomial model to estimate average per-trial probability and IIV in a word recall test with the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA). After adjusting for mean performance, in an analysis of 9,873 individuals observed across 7 (mean: 3.4) waves we found IIV to be greater: at older ages; with lower education; in females; with more difficulties with activities of daily living; in later cohorts; and when interviewers recorded issues which may have affected the tests. Our study identifies groups with more varying cognitive performance, which has implications for their daily functioning and care. Further work is needed to identify the impact of this for future health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Only a small proportion of individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) will convert to dementia. Methods currently available to identify risk for conversion do not combine enough sensitivity and specificity, which is even more problematic in low-educated populations. Current guidelines suggest the use of combined markers for dementia to enhance the prediction accuracy of assessment methods. The present study adhered to this proposal and investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the electrophysiological component P300 and standard neuropsychological tests to assess patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and MCI recruited from a low-income country. The neuropsychological battery comprised tests of memory, attention, language, praxis, and executive functions. The P300 was recorded using a classical visual odd-ball paradigm. Three variables were found to achieve sensitivity and specificity values above 80\% (Immediate and Delayed recall of word list – CERAD – and the latency of P300) for both MCI and AD. When they entered the model together (i.e., combined approach) the sensitivity for MCI increased to 96\% and the specificity remained high (80\%). Our preliminary findings suggest that the combined use of sensitive neuropsychological tasks and the analysis of the P300 may offer a very useful method for the preclinical assessment of AD, particularly in populations with low socioeconomic and educational levels. Our results provide a platform and justification to employ more resources to convert P300 and related parameters into a biological marker for AD.},

  abstract = {Recent scientific initiatives have called for increased use of neurobiological variables in clinical and other applied assessments. However, the task of incorporating neural measures into psychological assessments entails significant methodological challenges that have not been effectively addressed to date. As result, neurophysiological measures remain underutilized in clinical and applied assessments, and formal procedures for integrating such measures with report-based measures are lacking. In this paper, we discuss major methodological issues that have impeded progress in this direction, and propose a systematic research strategy for integrating neurophysiological measures into psychological assessment protocols. The strategy we propose is an iterative psychoneurometric approach that provides a means to establish multi-method (MM) measurement models for core biobehavioral traits that influence functioning across diverse areas of life. We provide a detailed illustration of a MM model for one such trait, inhibitory control (inhibition-disinhibition), and highlight work being done to develop counterpart models for other biobehavioral traits (i.e., threat sensitivity, reward sensitivity, affiliative capacity). We discuss how these measurement models can be refined and extended through use of already existing datasets, and outline steps that can be taken to establish norms for MM assessments and optimize the feasibility of their use in everyday practice. We believe this model-oriented strategy can provide a viable pathway toward effective use of neurophysiological measures in routine clinical assessments.},

We hypothesized that reduced P300 is an indicator of the common factor that underlies disorders within this spectrum. Community males (N=969) were assessed at age 17 in a visual oddball task. Externalizing was defined as the common factor underlying symptoms of alcohol dependence, drug dependence, nicotine dependence, conduct disorder, and adult antisocial behavior. A robust association was found between reduced P300 amplitude and the externalizing factor, and this relation accounted for links between specific externalizing disorders and P300.

  abstract = {Addiction is a chronic compulsion and relapsing disorder. It involves several brain areas and circuits, which encode vary functions such as reward, motivation, and memory. Drug addiction is defined as a “pathological pattern of use of a substance”, characterized by the loss of control on drug-taking-related behaviors, the pursuance of those behaviors even in the presence of negative consequences, and a strong motivated activity to assume substances. Three different theories guide experimental research on drug addiction. Each of these theories consider singles features, such as an aberrant motivation, a hedonic dysregulation, and an aberrant habit learning as the main actor to explain the entire process of the addictive behaviors. The major goal of this study is to present a new hypotheses of transitionality from a controlled use to abuse of addictive substances trough the overview of the three different theories, considering all the single features of each single theory together on the same “temporal continuum” from use to abuse of addictive substances. Recently, it has been suggested that common neural systems may be activated by natural and pharmacological stimuli, raising the hypotheses that binge-eating disorders could be considered as addictive behaviors. The second goal of this study is to present evidences in order to highlight a possible psycho-bio-physiological superimposition between drug and “food addiction”. Finally, interesting questions are brought up starting from last findings about a theoretical/psycho-bio-physiological superimposition between drug and “food addiction” and their possibly same transitionality along the same “temporal continuum” from use to abuse of addictive substances in order to investigate new therapeutic strategies based on new therapeutic strategies based on the individual moments characterizing the transition from the voluntary intake of substances to the maladaptive addictive behavior.},

It contains 23 lectures, most of which were delivered in the spring of 1924 at the Military Medical Academy in Leningrad. After an initial discussion of historical background and of the technical methods employed, Pavlov discusses the following topics: the formation of conditioned reflexes by means of conditioned and direct stimuli; external and internal inhibition of conditioned reflexes; the analyzing and synthesizing activity of the cerebral hemisphere; irradiation and concentration of nervous processes in the cerebral cortex; mutual induction of excitation and inhibition; interaction of irradiation and concentration with induction; the cortex as a mosaic of functions; development of inhibition in the cortex under the influence of conditioned stimuli; internal inhibition and sleep as one and the same process with regard to their intimate mechanism; transition stages between the alert state and complete sleep-hypnotic stages; different types of nervous system; pathological disturbances of the cortex, result of functional and surgical interference; general characteristics of the present investigation and its special difficulties; discovery of certain errors necessitating the modification of some earlier interpretations; and the experimental results obtained with animals in their application to man. Attention is drawn to the similarity of the neuroses and psychoses to behavior observed in the dog during certain of the experiments. A bibliography is given of all papers published from Pavlov's laboratories upon the physiology of conditioned reflexes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have been rarely included in large-scale studies. This is arguably not due to a lack of information that lies in EEG recordings but mainly on account of methodological issues. In many cases, particularly in clinical, pediatric and aging populations, the EEG has a high degree of artifact contamination and the quality of EEG recordings often substantially differs between subjects. Although there exists a variety of standardized preprocessing methods to clean EEG from artifacts, currently there is no method to objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG. This makes the commonly accepted procedure of excluding subjects from analyses due to exceeding contamination of artifacts highly subjective. As a consequence, P-hacking is fostered, the replicability of results is decreased, and it is difficult to pool data from different study sites. In addition, in large-scale studies, data are collected over years or even decades, requiring software that controls and manages the preprocessing of ongoing and dynamically growing studies. To address these challenges, we developed Automagic, an open-source MATLAB toolbox that acts as a wrapper to run currently available preprocessing methods and offers objective standardized quality assessment for growing studies. The software is compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard and hence facilitates data sharing. In the present paper we outline the functionality of Automagic and examine the effect of applying combinations of methods on a sample of resting and task-based EEG data. This examination suggests that applying a pipeline of algorithms to detect artifactual channels in combination with Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), an independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction method, is sufficient to reduce a large extent of artifacts.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with considerable impairment in psychiatric and functional domains. Although stimulant medication can reduce core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, a subgroup of patients does not respond to this intervention. A precision medicine approach has been proposed, whereby biomarkers are used to identify an effective treatment approach for a given individual. This review synthesizes the existing literature on event-related potential (ERP) correlates of stimulant response in children diagnosed with ADHD, with the goal of evaluating the potential for ERP to inform precision medicine care in this population. Forty-three articles were examined and results tentatively suggest that stimulant medications normalize the amplitude of the P300 component, and this is also associated with behavioral improvement. In contrast, results generally indicate that stimulants do not significantly alter early processing components, although there are some exceptions to this finding. Implications for research, theory, and clinical work are considered and concrete recommendations for future directions are provided. While recognizing limitations of existing literature (e.g., homogenous samples, variable methodologies), we conclude that ERP methods represent a promising approach for precision medicine care of patients with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Children with learning difficulties suffer from working memory (WM) deficits. Yet the specificity of deficits associated with different types of learning difficulties remains unclear. Further research can contribute to our understanding of the nature of WM and the relationship between it and learning difficulties. The current meta-analysis synthesized research on verbal WM and numerical WM among children with reading difficulties (RD), children with mathematics difficulties (MD), and children with reading and mathematics difficulties (RDMD). A total of 29 studies subsuming 110 comparisons were included. Results showed that compared to typically developing children, all learning difficulty groups demonstrated deficits in verbal WM and numerical WM, with RDMD children showing the most severe WM deficits. MD children and RD children showed comparable verbal WM deficits, but MD children showed more severe numerical WM deficits than RD children. Neither severity of learning difficulties nor type of academic screening emerged as a moderator of WM deficit profiles. Although the findings indicate the domain-general nature of WM deficits in RD, MD, and RDMD children, the numerical WM deficits of children with MD and RDMD may reflect the domain-specific nature of WM deficits.},

So there is a potential contradiction in our explanatory frameworks for understanding developmental disorders. This paper attempts to resolve this contradiction by presenting a multiple cognitive deWcit model of developmental disorders. It describes how this model evolved out of our attempts to understand two comorbidities, those between dyslexia and attention deWcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and between dyslexia and speech sound disorder (SSD).},

The aim of this study was to investigate maturation of the P300 component and its habituation (short-term automatic learning) in a sample of healthy children and adolescents. Four models of maturation of the P300 (linear, quadratic or two different linear regressions for the pre-pubertal and pubertal age groups as well as age-inverse) were applied and compared, in order to find the most adequate model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion. A visual oddball paradigm was presented to 81 healthy children and adolescents aged 6–18years. Three blocks, each with 200 trials were recorded to assess between-block habituation. The data was best fitted to (a) an age-inverse relation between P300 latency and age, and (b) a linear relationship between P300 amplitude and age. An age-dependent effect of habituation was detected in the P300 amplitude, where a considerable amplitude decline was found in the younger children and no significant change for adolescents. Our results support the hypothesis that younger children show stronger habituation effects because they activate a larger neuronal pool from which unnecessary neurons can be excluded during short-term learning. In contrast, in adolescents, these neurons may have already been eliminated as a consequence of pruning, thus reducing habituation effects. Future studies are required to test this hypothesis because our data do not permit alternative explanations to be discarded.},

Updates regarding comorbidity, shared neuropsychological factors, and reasons for the changes in diagnostic criteria are addressed. Although the revisions in the DSM-5 may allow for better diagnostic sensitivity based on the symptomology, specifiers, and the clinical features outlined, there continues to be challenges in operationalizing SLD and implementing consistent assessment practices among mental health professionals particularly when considering the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which provides guidelines in the evaluation of SLD in school settings. Clinical and educational assessment implications are discussed with special attention to develop a collaborative approach between psychiatrists, psychologists, and educators when providing service delivery for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disabilities.},

In this article we introduce scholars of (digital) journalism studies and communication science to multiverse analysis while addressing the possible reasons of heterogeneity in the findings of research on engagement with news on social media. Using the question of which news article characteristics predict news engagement on social media, this illustration of the multiverse approach shows how different measurement, data processing, and modelling choices lead to divergent conclusions. In particular, we show how the selection of widely used automated text analysis tools and preprocessing steps influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis. We also use this illustration to guide interested scholars through the different steps of doing a multiverse analysis. More broadly, we demonstrate how multiverse analysis can be an open and transparent research approach in a field that is increasingly faced with a wide range of analytical choices.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Most behavior checklists for attention problems or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) such as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) have a narrow range of scores, focusing on the extent to which problems are present. It has been proposed that measuring attention on a continuum, from positive attention skills to attention problems, will add value to our understanding of ADHD and related problems. The Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD symptoms and Normal behavior scale (SWAN) is such a scale. Items of the SWAN are scored on a seven-point scale, with in the middle ‘average behavior’ and on the extremes ‘far below average’ and ‘far above average’. Method: The SWAN and the CBCL were completed by mothers of respectively 560 and 469 12-year-old twin pairs. The SWAN consists of nine DSM-IV items for Attention Deficit (AD) and nine DSM-IV items for Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (HI). The CBCL Attention Problem (AP) scale consists of 11 items, which are rated on a three-point scale. Results: Children who had a score of zero on the CBCL AP scale can be further differentiated using the SWAN, with variation seen between the average behavior and far above average range. In addition, SWAN scores were normally distributed, rather than kurtotic or skewed as is often seen with other behavioral checklists. The CBCL AP scale and the SWAN-HI and AD scale were strongly influenced by genetic factors (73\%, 90\% and 82\%, respectively). However, there were striking differences in genetic architecture: variation in CBCL AP scores is in large part explained by non-additive genetic influences. Variation in SWAN scores is explained by additive genetic influences only. Conclusion: Ratings on the SWAN cover the continuum from positive attention skills to attention and hyperactivity problems that define ADHD. Instruments such as the SWAN offer clinicians and researchers the opportunity to examine variation in both strengths and weaknesses in attention skills.},

A simple auditory task was employed in which subjects indicated with a finger movement when a randomly occuring target tone (high pitch) was presented in a series of standard (low pitch) tones. The probability of the target tone was varied across conditions at 10\%, 30\%, or 50\% to assess possible developmental changes in P300 amplitude. Memory capacity was assessed with forward and reverse digit spans. Circumference of the head also was measured. P300 latency decreased with age, and P300 amplitude tended to become larger with age. Polynomial regression analyses revealed significant quadratic trends in these relationships, with changes leveling off for older subjects. Digit span and head circumference also were related curvilinearly to P300 values. Multiple regression analysis indicated that changes in age and memory span both predicted significant changes in P300 latency and amplitude. Target stimulus probability generally affected all subjects in a similar fashion, although the strength of the correlational relationships tended to decline with increases in probability. Developmental changes for the N1, P2, and N2 components from the standard stimuli also were obtained. The results are discussed in terms of previous P3 findings for children and their implications for future studies.},

The oddball paradigm presented both target and standard stimuli; the single-stimulus paradigm presented a target but no standard tone stimulus, with the inter-target interval the same as that for the oddball condition. Target stimulus probability was manipulated in the oddball task in different conditions (0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90). The single-stimulus paradigm employed the same procedures such that the inter-target interval was identical as that for the oddball condition across changes in probability. P300 amplitude and latency were similar for both the oddball and single-stimulus procedures across probability levels. Correlations between the P300 values from each task mimicked those from test–retest comparisons for the oddball paradigm. The findings suggest that P300 from the single-stimulus paradigm responds to target stimulus probability in the same fashion as the traditional oddball. The implications of the single-stimulus technique are discussed in terms of applied contexts that require very simple ERP task conditions.© 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

P300 amplitude was smaller and peak latency longer for the more difficult relative to the easier tasks across experiments. Increases in stimulus target probability generally diminished P300 amplitude and shortened peak latency more for the easy relative to difficult task conditions. Increasing the number of non-target stimulus tones decreased P300 amplitude reliably, but increased latency only slightly. Task difficulty did not interact with variations in inter-stimulus interval which produced generally weak effects for both amplitude and latency. These findings suggests that P300 amplitude and latency obtained from auditory discrimination paradigms reflect processing difficulty independently of stimulus target probability unless differences in task requirements affect stimulus encoding.},

The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted.

Such a theory would not only be able to accurately describe lab-based empirical effects but would also be practically useful.

Stimulusfeature-based encoding models are becoming increasingly popular for inferring the dimensions of neural representational spaces from stimulus-feature spaces. We argue that such inferences are not always valid because successful prediction can occur even if the two representational spaces use different, but correlated, representational schemes. We support this claim with three simulations in which we achieved high prediction accuracy despite systematic differences in the geometries and dimensions of the underlying representations. Detailed analysis of the encoding models' predictions showed systematic deviations from ground-truth, indicating that high prediction accuracy is insufficient for making representational inferences. This fallacy applies to the prediction of actual neural patterns from stimulus-feature spaces and we urge caution in inferring the nature of the neural code from such methods. We discuss ways to overcome these inferential limitations, including model comparison, absolute model performance, visualization techniques and attentional modulation.},

Most analyzed studies came from the tertiary level of education, but there were similar aggregate samples from secondary and tertiary education. There was a comparatively smaller sample derived from studies at primary level. Academic performance was found to significantly correlate with Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience. Where tested, correlations between Conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. When secondary academic performance was controlled for, Conscientiousness added as much to the prediction of tertiary academic performance as did intelligence. Strong evidence was found for moderators of correlations. Academic level (primary, secondary or tertiary), average age of participant, and the interaction between academic level and age significantly moderated correlations with academic performance. Possible explanations for these moderator effects are discussed and recommendations for future research are provided.},

  abstract = {Cognitive neuroscience research on working memory has been largely motivated by a standard model that arose from the melding of psychological theory with neuroscience data. Among the tenets of this standard model are that working memory functions arise from the operation of specialized systems that act as buffers for the storage and manipulation of information, and that frontal cortex (particularly prefrontal cortex) is a critical neural substrate for these specialized systems. However, the standard model has been a victim of its own success, and can no longer accommodate many of the empirical findings of studies that it has motivated. An alternative is proposed: Working memory functions arise through the coordinated recruitment, via attention, of brain systems that have evolved to accomplish sensory-, representation-, and action-related functions. Evidence from behavioral, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies, from monkeys and humans, is considered, as is the question of how to interpret delay-period activity in the prefrontal cortex. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.},

P300 is emitted by the brain in response to either attended events that are surprising or to unattended events that produce orienting. P300 does not appear to be a real-time index of signal (target) selection, since attended low-probability nonsignals also result in P300 and its latency is too long. P300 further appears to be independent of response selection; its latency therefore may or may not correlate with RT, depending on the experimental context. P300 latency does appear to index stimulus evaluation time in that it is not emitted until the stimulus has been cognitively evaluated. P300 amplitude appears sensitive to manipulations of perceptual limited capacity but not sensitive to manipulations of motor limited capacity. It has been proposed that P300's functional role in human information processing is the updating of neurocognitive models concerning future events, although other functions have also been proposed.

  abstract = {Reliable and valid assessment of students’ academic potential has huge consequences for their future success. To date, this has almost exclusively been achieved through the administration of pencil-and-paper aptitude assessments or self-report instruments. Performance on these assessments can be influenced by factors such as test anxiety, providing an inaccurate prediction of a student’s potential. These methods also ignore that academic performance is the product of brain activity. Limits associated with these past practices can be addressed through the identification of robust neuromarkers of academic performance. The P3 component of the event-related potential, thought to index cognitive processes underlying learning, is one such promising candidate. Previous studies have identified significant associations between temporal characteristics of the P3 and a number of academic performance measures, highlighting its utility as a neuromarker. This brief review summarizes previous work on the P3 component and academic performance, and outlines considerations for future research.},

First, models are discussed in which the two random factors of participants and items are crossed, and not nested. Traditional ANOVAs are compared against these crossed mixed-effects models, for simulated and real data. Results indicate that the mixed-effects method has a lower risk of capitalization on chance (Type I error). Second, mixed-effects models of logistic regression (generalized linear mixed models, GLMM) are discussed and demonstrated with simulated binomial data. Mixed-effects models effectively solve the “language-as-fixed-effect-fallacy”, and have several other advantages. In conclusion, mixed-effects models provide a superior method for analyzing psycholinguistic data.},

This article presents a new model for spacing based on the SAM theory of memory developed by Raaijmakers and Shiffrin (1980, 1981). The model is a generalization of the SAM model as applied to interference paradigms (Mensink \& Raaijmakers, 1988, 1989) and may be viewed as a mathematical version of the Component-Levels theory proposed by Glenberg (1979). It is assumed that on a second presentation of an item, information is added to an existing trace if the episodic memory image corresponding to that item is retrieved. If it is not retrieved, a new image is stored. It is shown that the model predicts many standard findings including the lack of a spacing effect for the recall of at least one of two items each presented once (Ross \& Landauer, 1978).},

  abstract = {Time of day (TOD) influences on executive functions have been widely reported, with greater efficiency demonstrated at optimal relative to non-optimal TOD according to one’s chronotype (i.e., synchrony effect). Older adults (OAs) show declines in inhibitory control and are more sensitive to the effects of circadian variation on executive functioning. To date, no studies have investigated the effects of TOD and aging on executive functioning using electrophysiological measures. The present study investigated the effects of aging and TOD on the neural correlates of inhibitory processing (N2 and P3) using event-related potentials (ERPs). Go-NoGo and Flanker tasks were administered to 52 OAs of morning chronotype and 51 younger adults (YAs) of afternoon-to-evening chronotype who were randomly assigned to morning or afternoon test sessions, with the optimal TOD for OAs in the morning and for YAs in the afternoon/evening. While behavioral results demonstrated no TOD effects, ERPs indicated synchrony effects. Both YAs and OAs showed greater modulation of Go-NoGo N2 and greater P3 amplitude during the non-optimal than optimal TOD, consistent with the synchrony effect. For the Flanker task, age differences in P3 amplitude were only apparent during the non-optimal TOD. These results suggest that processes associated with inhibitory control are differentially affected by TOD and aging, with age-related reductions in inhibitory efficiency during off-peak test times on measures of interference control. These findings highlight the sensitivity of ERPs to detect TOD effects in the absence of behavioral differences, confirm more pronounced TOD effects in OAs relative to YAs on ERP measures of interference control, and reinforce the need to assess and control for circadian typology in research studies.},

In the present study we manipulated novelty in a wordlearning task through task-irrelevant background images. These background images were either standard (presented repeatedly), or novel (presented only once). Two types of background images were used: Landscape pictures and fractals. EEG was also recorded during encoding. Contrary to the idea that novelty aids memory formation, memory performance was not affected by the novelty of the background. In the evoked response potentials, we found evidence of distracting effects of novelty: both the N1 and P3b components were smaller to words studied with novel backgrounds, and the amplitude of the N2b component correlated negatively with subsequent retrieval. We conclude that although evidence from other studies does suggest benefits on a longer time scale, novelty has no instantaneous benefits for learning.},

  abstract = {The P3 component (P300, P3b) is considered to be an effective index of attention and categorization processes when elicited in a visual oddball task, specifically reflecting the selection of a rare target item among frequent non-targets. Researchers have proposed that target categorization is guided by representations of target features held in working memory (WM), thus guiding attention and categorization processes to distinguish targets from non-targets. Although WM is theorized to have visuospatial, verbal and executive function components, most studies do not investigate how these WM components contribute to the P3. This study uses an individual differences approach to determine whether correlations between WM capabilities and P3 amplitudes indicate a common underlying cognitive construct. Participants (n~=~140) completed an 80/20 visual oddball task to elicit the P3 as well as independent visual working memory (VWM), spatial working memory (SPWM), and executive function (task switching (TS) and digit symbol substitution (DSS)) tests. Results indicated that measures of executive function, DSS and TS, but not VWM or SPWM ability, correlated with and predicted faster task response times and greater P3 amplitudes. RT and WM measures were not correlated with P3 fractional area latencies. These results support context updating theory. Executive function WM availability, whether as a property of the participant's processing system or based on task demands, plays a functional role in the P3 and an important role in efficient visual categorization and goal-directed learning.},

Understanding the cognitive processes involved in these tasks was obstructed initially by the lack of a coherent concept of short-term memory and later by the mistaken assumption that short-term and long-term memory reflected distinct processes as well as different kinds of experimental task. Despite its apparent conceptual simplicity, a variety of cognitive mechanisms are responsible for short-term memory, and contemporary theories of working memory have helped to clarify these. Contrary to the earliest writings on the subject, measures of short-term memory do not provide a simple measure of mental capacity, but they do provide a way of understanding some of the key mechanisms underlying human cognition.},

First, a brief historical overview is provided highlighting seminal studies that began exploration of the P300 component in developmental groups. Overall, these studies suggest that the P300 can be detected in children and appears to reflect similar cognitive processes to those in adults; however, it is significantly delayed in its latency to peak. Second, two striking findings from developmental research are the lack of a clear P300 component in infancy and differential electrophysiological responses to novel, unexpected stimuli in children, adolescents, and adults. Third, contemporary questions are described, which include P300-like components in infancy, alteration of P300 in atypically developing groups, relations between P300 and behavior, individual differences of P300, and neural substrates of P300 across development. Finally, we conclude with comments regarding the power of a developmental perspective and suggestions for important issues that should be addressed in the next 50 years of P300 research.},

Tones delivered every 2 sec resulted in a rapid drop, during the first few stimuli, in the amplitude of the positive component of vertex responses which peaks between 150 and 200 msec; but no similar change was found for tones delivered every 10 sec. The rapid drop for the faster rate of stimulation was considered to have only the appearance of habituation, and was viewed as reflecting refractoriness within the auditory system. On the other hand, when the first stimulus was presented in an unpredictable manner it elicited a large positive component with a peak latency of about 300 msec. Similar responses were obtained when an unpredictable pitch change was presented in an effort to elicit dishabituation. Predictable pitch changes did not produce these results. The 300 msec component was seen as reflecting a shift of attention associated with the orienting response. Résumé L'habituation à court terme chez des sujets humains est étudiée par une méthode qui fournit une analyse de la moyenne des réponses évoquées stimulus par stimulus. Des tons délivrés toutes les deux secondes déterminent une chute rapide de l'amplitude du composant positif des réponses du vertex avec des pointes comprises entre 150 et 200 msec, durant les quelques preiers stimuli. Mais les auteurs ne trouvérent pas de changement semblable si les tons se produisent toutes les 10 sec. La chute rapide pour le taux plus rapide de stimulation est considérée comme ayant seulement l'apparence de l'habituation, et est analysée comme reflétant un état réfractaire du systéme auditif. D'autre part, quand le premier stimulus est présenté d'une maniére imprévisible, il détermine un grand composant positif avec une latence au pick de l'ordre de 300 msec. Des réponses semblables sont obtenues quand un changement imprévisible du diapason est fait dans le but d'entraîner une “déshabituation”. Des changements prévisibles du diapason ne produisent pas ces résultats. Le composant d'une latence de 300 msec est vu comme reflétant une onde d'attention associée avec la réponse d'orientation.},

  abstract = {The event related potential (ERP) technique is a useful methodology for studying neural changes underlying memory development during childhood. However, systematic comparisons of differences in memory tasks and retrieval demands are lacking. To address this gap, the present study explored the effects of memory task (i.e., item versus source) and retrieval paradigm (i.e., intentional versus incidental) on 4- to 5-year-old children's memory performance and associated electrophysiological responses. Children were familiarized with items in a play-like setting and then asked to retrieve item or source memory details while their brain activity was recorded (intentional retrieval) or while they passively viewed images of the items with no explicit task (incidental retrieval). Memory assessments for the incidental groups followed ERP recording. Analyses of the ERP data suggested that the brain's response during intentional retrieval of source information differed from the other three conditions. These results are discussed within a two-component framework of memory development (e.g., Shing et al., 2010), and implications for future methodological decisions are presented. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Paul Meehl raised this very concern more than 40 years ago. Yet in the ensuing decades, little has improved. We aim to chart a better path forward for psychological theory by revisiting Meehl’s criticisms, his proposed solution, and the reasons his solution failed to meaningfully change the status of psychological theory. We argue that Meehl identified serious shortcomings in our evaluation of psychological theories and that his proposed solution would substantially strengthen theory testing. However, we also argue that Meehl failed to provide researchers with the tools necessary to construct the kinds of rigorous theories his approach required. To advance psychological theory, we must equip researchers with tools that allow them to better generate, evaluate, and develop their theories. We argue that formal theories provide this much-needed set of tools, equipping researchers with tools for thinking, evaluating explanation, enhancing measurement, informing theory development, and promoting the collaborative construction of psychological theories.},

This research program moves away from the disorder-based ‘one-model-fits-all’ approach to treating mental disorders, and adopts the network approach to psychopathology as its foundation of research. Its core assumption is that dynamically interacting symptoms constitute the disorder. Our goal is to further develop the network approach by studying (1) dynamic networks of symptoms and other variables (i.e., elements) in a large number of individuals with a wide range of mental disorders from a transdiagnostic perspective (network-based diagnosis; mapping), including both Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and digital phenotyping, (2) the transdiagnostic mechanisms reflecting potential causal relations among elements of the networks by performing experimental (pre-)clinical studies (zooming), and (3) the effectiveness of personalised network-informed interventions (targeting). Challenges to overcome in this research program are discussed, which relate to data collection (e.g., selection of EMA variables) and data analyses (e.g., power considerations), the development and application of network-informed diagnoses and network-informed interventions (e.g., what characteristic(s) of the network to target in interventions), and the implementation in clinical practice (e.g., train therapists in the use of networks in therapy).},

We discuss why reversing arrows or comparing model fit indices cannot tell us which model is the right one and how tests of conditional independence can at least tell us where our model goes wrong. Causal modeling practices in psychology are far from optimal but may be kept alive by domain norms that demand every article makes some novel claim about processes and boundary conditions. We end with a vision for a different research culture in which causal inference is pursued in a much slower, more deliberate, and collaborative manner.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

Although we have made significant progress towards this goal, reliance on group-level studies of the developed adult brain has limited our ability to explain population variability and developmental changes in neural circuitry and behavior. In this review, we suggest that predictive modeling, a method for predicting individual differences in behavior from brain features, can complement descriptive approaches and provide new ways to account for this variability. Highlighting the outsized scientific and clinical benefits of prediction in developmental populations including adolescence, we show that predictive brain-based models are already providing new insights on adolescent-specific risk-related behaviors. Together with large-scale developmental neuroimaging datasets and complementary analytic approaches, predictive modeling affords us the opportunity and obligation to identify novel treatment targets and individually tailor the course of interventions for developmental psychopathologies that impact so many young people today.},

Using a series of four highly studied “textbook” examples from different research domains (eyewitness memory, deductive reasoning, social psychology, and child welfare), we show how simple unrecognized incompatibilities among dependent measures, analysis tools, and the properties of data can lead to fundamental interpretive errors. These errors, which are not reduced by additional data collection, may lead to misguided research efforts and policy recommendations. We conclude with a set of recommended strategies and research tools to reduce the probability of these persistent and largely unrecognized errors. The use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves is highlighted as one such recommendation.},

  abstract = {Objective A substantial body of evidence shows that several separate components underlie the late positive complex (LPC) of the ERP. Each of these has been proposed as a possible neural index of the orienting reflex (OR), but none has clearly met the criteria required for identification as an OR. The skin conductance response (SCR) is the most extensively examined index of the OR, and was used here as an OR ‘yard-stick’. The primary aim of this study was to determine if any of the components of the LPC show stimulus–response relationships analogous to those of the SCR. Methods ERPs and SCRs were simultaneously recorded from 72 subjects during an ERP dishabituation paradigm, in which a habituation stimulus (S1) was presented for a series of trials, during which a different stimulus (S2) was interpolated. This sequence was presented in a series of trains, allowing across-train LPC and SCR exploration as a function of trial. The sensitivity of these components to stimulus intensity and significance, other stimulus dimensions important in defining the OR, was also examined. We utilised a PCA with varimax rotation to separate the ERP components underlying the LPC. Results Four factors extracted appeared to correspond to the classic Slow Wave, the P3b, the Novelty P3 and the P3a. While the LPC exhibited a stimulus–response relationship analogous to the SCR, each of the separate components was differentially sensitive to aspects of the stimulus manipulations examined here. Conclusions This study has demonstrated that the LPC is an adequate EEG index of the OR. However, the underlying components of the LPC examined here—which we consider to be the classic slow wave, P3b, Novelty P3 and P3a—cannot be used interchangeably as OR indices. Significance This study clarifies links between the autonomic OR and its CNS correlates.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the mechanisms of human memory is a central goal of neuroscience, both from the point of view of the fundamental biology of memory and for its translational relevance. Here, we review some contributions that recordings from neurons in humans implanted with electrodes for clinical purposes have made toward this goal. Recordings from the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, reveal the existence of two classes of cells: those encoding highly selective and invariant representations of abstract concepts, and memory-selective cells whose activity is related to familiarity and episodic retrieval. Insights derived from observing these cells in behaving humans include that semantic representations are activated before episodic representations, that memory content and memory strength are segregated, and that the activity of both types of cells is related to subjective awareness as expected from a substrate for declarative memory. Visually selective cells can remain persistently active for several seconds, thereby revealing a cellular substrate for working memory in humans. An overarching insight is that the neural code of human memory is interpretable at the single-neuron level. Jointly, intracranial recording studies are starting to reveal aspects of the building blocks of human memory at the single-cell level. This work establishes a bridge to cellular-level work in animals on the one hand, and the extensive literature on noninvasive imaging in humans on the other hand. More broadly, this work is a step toward a detailed mechanistic understanding of human memory that is needed to develop therapies for human memory disorders.},

  abstract = {Background/Study Context: Research suggests that mental representations of time encompass multiple distinct aspects that vary with age, but prior studies rarely assessed more than one aspect of time perception and did not systematically consider relevant covariates. This lack of integration across studies hampers theory building and limits a deeper understanding of underlying constructs.Methods: Five widely used and conceptually distinct measures of time perception (i.e., perceived life position, global future horizons, future orientation and planning, self-continuity, and the temporal extension of episodic future thought) were administered to a demographically stratified adult life-span sample. Theoretically implicated covariates, including cognition, current affect, personality, and subjective health, were also assessed.Results: Principle component analyses suggested a four-component solution. Perceived life position and global future horizons formed a single component reflecting subjective life span; the remaining measures each constituted separate components. The life span component and episodic future thought were negatively associated with age, self-continuity was positively associated with age, and future orientation did not vary by age. Among the covariates, mental and physical health showed the most pronounced associations with time perceptions, but the direction of effects varied across components.Conclusion: Findings suggest that mental representations of time encompass multiple components that show distinct age patterns and associations with covariates. Implications for theory building and practical applications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Negative psychiatric symptoms are often resistant to treatments, regardless of the disorder in which they appear. One model for a cause of negative symptoms is impairment in higher-order cognition. The current study examined how particular bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of selective attention relate to severity of negative symptoms across a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample. Methods: The sample consisted of 130 participants: 25 schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, 26 bipolar disorders, 18 unipolar depression, and 61 nonpsychiatric controls. The relationships between attentional event-related potentials following rare visual targets (i.e., N1, N2b, P2a, and P3b) and severity of the negative symptom domains of anhedonia, avolition, and blunted affect were evaluated using frequentist and Bayesian analyses. Results: P3b and N2b mean amplitudes were inversely related to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Negative Symptom Factor severity score across the entire sample. Subsequent regression analyses showed a significant negative transdiagnostic relationship between P3b amplitude and blunted affect severity. Conclusions: Results indicate that negative symptoms, and particularly blunted affect, may have a stronger association with deficits in top-down mechanisms of selective attention. Significance: This suggests that people with greater severity of blunted affect, independent of diagnosis, do not allocate sufficient cognitive resources when engaging in activities requiring selective attention.

However, many studies examining age-related effects are cross-sectional, and few have considered the unique role that pubertal development may have on P300 developmental trajectories. The current study examined whether age, pubertal maturation or their interaction predicted changes in P300 amplitude over two years among 129 females between the ages of 8 and 15 years at baseline. Participants completed a flanker task while EEG was recorded at a baseline and two-year follow-up visit. Both baseline age and increased pubertal development were associated with smaller P300 amplitude at follow-up. However, the influence of age was qualified by an interaction between age and pubertal maturation: among younger girls only, increased pubertal development predicted decreases in P300, whereas decreased pubertal development predicted increases in P300. These data indicate that pubertal timing impacts neurodevelopmental changes in P300 amplitude – such that high versus low pubertal development among 8- to 10-year-old girls predicted differential trajectories of neural activity. In light of links between reduced P300 and mental health disorders, such as depression, future studies might examine whether neurodevelopmental changes influenced by early-onset pubertal development could account for increases in these mental health problems.},

To date, depression-related P300 amplitude reduction has mostly been demonstrated cross-sectionally, while its clinical implication for the course of depression remains largely unclear. Moreover, the relationship between P300 and specific clinical characteristics of depression is uncertain. To shed light on the functional significance of the P300 in depression, we examined whether initial P300 amplitude prospectively predicted changes in depressive symptoms among a community sample of 58 adults (mean age = 38.86 years old, 81\% female) with a current depressive disorder. This sample was assessed at two-time points, separated by approximately nine months (range = 6.6–15.9). At the initial visit, participants completed clinical interviews, self-report measures, and a flanker task, while EEG was recorded to derive P300 amplitude. At the follow-up visit, participants again completed the same clinical interviews and self-report measures. Results indicated that a reduced P300 amplitude at the initial visit was associated with higher total depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for initial depressive symptoms. These data indicate the potential clinical utility for the P300 as a neural marker of disease course among adults with a current depressive disorder. Future research may target P300 in interventions to determine whether depression-related outcomes can be improved.},

Reprinted by permission of Basic Books, a member of The Perseus Books Group.The notion that addiction is a “brain disease” has become widespread and rarely challenged. The brain-disease model implies erroneously that the brain is necessarily the most important and useful level of analysis for understanding and treating addiction. This paper will explain the limits of over-medicalizing – while acknowledging a legitimate place for medication in the therapeutic repertoire – and why a broader perspective on the problems of the addicted person is essential to understanding addiction and to providing optimal care. In short, the brain-disease model obscures the dimension of choice in addiction, the capacity to respond to incentives, and also the essential fact people use drugs for reasons (as consistent with a self-medication hypothesis). The latter becomes obvious when patients become abstinent yet still struggle to assume rewarding lives in the realm of work and relationships. Thankfully, addicts can choose to recover and are not helpless victims of their own “hijacked brains.”},

  abstract = {Developmental researchers are often interested in event-related potentials (ERPs). Data-analytic approaches based on the observed ERP suffer from major problems such as arbitrary definition of analysis time windows and regions of interest and the observed ERP being a mixture of latent underlying components. Temporal principal component analysis (PCA) can reduce these problems. However, its application in developmental research comes with the unique challenge that the component structure differs between age groups (so-called measurement non-invariance). Separate PCAs for the groups can cope with this challenge. We demonstrate how to make results from separate PCAs accessible for inferential statistics by re-scaling to original units. This tutorial enables readers with a focus on developmental research to conduct a PCA-based ERP analysis of amplitude differences. We explain the benefits of a PCA-based approach, introduce the PCA model and demonstrate its application to a developmental research question using real-data from a child and an adult group (code and data openly available). Finally, we discuss how to cope with typical challenges during the analysis and name potential limitations such as suboptimal decomposition results, data-driven analysis decisions and latency shifts.},

At the beginning of the study, 100 kindergarten children (mean age 612 years) were tested on various memory measures, including sort–recall, text recall, short-term memory capacity, and metamemory. Assessments were repeated twice, with adjacent measurement points separated by 6-month time intervals. One major goal of the initial phase of the study concerned the exploration of the utilization deficiency phenomenon, which refers to the fact that young children who spontaneously use a memory strategy for the first time do not experience immediate memory benefits. Results obtained for the sort–recall task showed that, among those children who acquired a sorting strategy between Times 1 and 2, only a small proportion experienced the utilization deficiency problem. Additional analyses demonstrated that these few children also performed more poorly on the short-term memory tasks and the text recall measure when compared with the groups of efficient strategy users, suggesting that utilization deficiency is accompanied by a more general memory capacity problem. Overall, the findings revealed enormous variability in the early acquisition of memory strategies, indicating that the utilization deficiency phenomenon might not be as frequent as is assumed in the relevant literature.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in processing speed are consistently related to individual differences in cognitive abilities, but the mechanisms through which a higher processing speed facilitates reasoning remain largely unknown. To identify these mechanisms, researchers have been using latencies of the event-related potential (ERP) to study how the speed of cognitive processes associated with specific ERP components is related to cognitive abilities. Although there is some evidence that latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order cognitive processes are related to intelligence, results are overall quite inconsistent. These inconsistencies likely result from variations in analytic procedures and little consideration of the psychometric properties of ERP latencies in relatively small sample studies. Here we used a multiverse approach to evaluate how different analytical choices regarding references, low-pass filter cutoffs, and latency measures affect the psychometric properties of P2, N2, and P3 latencies and their relations with cognitive abilities in a sample of 148 participants. Latent correlations between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities ranged from −.49 to −.78. ERP latency measures contained about equal parts of measurement error variance and systematic variance, and only about half of the systematic variance was related to cognitive abilities, whereas the other half reflected nuisance factors. We recommend addressing these problematic psychometric properties by recording EEG data from multiple tasks and modeling relations between ERP latencies and covariates in latent variable models. All in all, our results indicate that there is a substantial and robust relationship between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities when those issues are addressed.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that individuals with greater cognitive abilities display a greater speed of higher-order cognitive processing. These results suggest that speeded neural information processing may facilitate evidence accumulation during decision making and memory updating and thus yield advantages in general cognitive abilities. We used a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive modeling approach to test the hypothesis that individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation mediate the relationship between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities. We found that a higher neural speed predicted both the velocity of evidence accumulation across behavioral tasks and cognitive ability test scores. However, only a negligible part of the association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities was mediated by individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation. The model demonstrated impressive forecasting abilities by predicting 36\% of individual variation in cognitive ability test scores in an entirely new sample solely based on their electrophysiological and behavioral data. Our results suggest that individual differences in neural processing speed might affect a plethora of higher-order cognitive processes, that only in concert explain the large association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities, instead of the effect being entirely explained by differences in evidence accumulation speeds.},

Theories of multimedia learning are based on Baddeley’s working memory model (Baddeley 1999). Despite this theoretical foundation, there is only little research that aims at empirically testing whether and more importantly how working memory contributes to learning from text and pictures; however, a more thorough understanding of how working memory limitations affect learning may help instructional designers to optimize multimedia instruction. Therefore, the goal of this review is to stimulate such empirical research by (1) providing an overview of the methodologies that can be applied to gain insights in working memory involvement during multimedia learning, (2) reviewing studies that have used these methodologies in multimedia research already, and (3) discussing methodological and theoretical challenges of such an approach as well as the usefulness of working memory to explain learning with multimedia.},

  abstract = {A number of developmental theories have been proposed that make differential predictions about the links between age and temporal discounting, or the devaluation of future rewards. Most empirical studies examining adult age differences in temporal discounting have relied on economic intertemporal choice tasks, which pit choosing a smaller, sooner monetary reward against choosing a larger, later one. Although initial studies using these tasks suggested older adults discount less than younger adults, follow-up studies provided heterogeneous, and thus inconclusive, results. Using an open science approach, we test the replicability of adult age differences in temporal discounting by conducting a preregistered systematic literature search and meta-analysis of adult age differences in intertemporal choice tasks. Across 37 cross-sectional studies (Total N = 104,737), a planned meta-analysis found no sizeable relation between age and temporal discounting, r = −0.068, 95\% CI [−0.170, 0.035]. We also found little evidence of publication bias or p-hacking. Exploratory analyses of moderators found no effect of research design (e.g., extreme-group vs. continuous age), incentives (hypothetical vs. real rewards), duration of delay (e.g., days, weeks, months, or years), or quantification of discounting behavior (e.g., proportion of immediate choices vs. parameters from computational modeling). Additional analyses of 12 participant-level data sets found little support for a nonlinear relation between age and temporal discounting across adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that younger, middle-aged, and older adults show similar preferences for smaller, sooner over larger, later rewards. We provide recommendations for future empirical work on temporal discounting across the adult life span. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In the phenomenon of attentional blink, identical visual stimuli are sometimes fully perceived and sometimes not detected at all. This phenomenon thus provides an optimal situation to study the fate of stimuli not consciously perceived and the differences between conscious and nonconscious processing. We correlated behavioral visibility ratings and recordings of event-related potentials to study the temporal dynamics of access to consciousness. Intact early potentials (P1 and N1) were evoked by unseen words, suggesting that these brain events are not the primary correlates of conscious perception. However, we observed a rapid divergence around 270 ms, after which several brain events were evoked solely by seen words. Thus, we suggest that the transition toward access to consciousness relates to the optional triggering of a late wave of activation that spreads through a distributed network of cortical association areas.},

  abstract = {In interpreting attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, categorical and dimensional approaches are commonly used. Both employ binary symptom counts which give equal weighting, with little attention to the combinations and relative contributions of individual symptoms. Alternatively, symptoms can be viewed as an interacting network, revealing the complex relationship between symptoms. Using a novel network modelling approach, this study explores the relationships between the 18 symptoms in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria and whether network measures are useful in predicting outcomes. Participants were from a community cohort, the Children’s Attention Project. DSM ADHD symptoms were recorded in a face-to-face structured parent interview for 146 medication naïve children with ADHD and 209 controls (aged 6–8 years). Analyses indicated that not all symptoms are equal. Frequencies of endorsement and configurations of symptoms varied, with certain symptoms playing a more important role within the ADHD symptom network. In total, 116,220 combinations of symptoms within a diagnosis of ADHD were identified, with 92\% demonstrating a unique symptom configuration. Symptom association networks highlighted the relative importance of hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the symptom network. In particular, the ‘motoric’-type symptoms as well as interrupts as a marker of impulsivity in the hyperactive domain, as well as loses things and does not follow instructions in the inattentive domain, had high measures of centrality. Centrality-measure weighted symptom counts showed significant association with clinical but not cognitive outcomes, however the relationships were not significantly stronger than symptom count alone. The finding may help to explain heterogeneity in the ADHD phenotype.},

In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

  abstract = {Stress is a well-known risk factor in the development of addiction and in addiction relapse vulnerability. A series of population-based and epidemiological studies have identified specific stressors and individual-level variables that are predictive of substance use and abuse. Preclinical research also shows that stress exposure enhances drug self-administration and reinstates drug seeking in drug-experienced animals. The deleterious effects of early life stress, child maltreatment, and accumulated adversity on alterations in the corticotropin releasing factor and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (CRF/HPA), the extrahypothalamic CRF, the autonomic arousal, and the central noradrenergic systems are also presented. The effects of these alterations on the corticostriatal-limbic motivational, learning, and adaptation systems that include mesolimbic dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) pathways are discussed as the underlying pathophysiology associated with stress-related risk of addiction. The effects of regular and chronic drug use on alterations in these stress and motivational systems are also reviewed, with specific attention to the impact of these adaptations on stress regulation, impulse control, and perpetuation of compulsive drug seeking and relapse susceptibility. Finally, research gaps in furthering our understanding of the association between stress and addiction are presented, with the hope that addressing these unanswered questions will significantly influence new prevention and treatment strategies to address vulnerability to addiction.},

  abstract = {Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with changes in stress and reward pathways that could alter vulnerability to emotional stress and alcohol craving. This study examines whether chronic alcohol abuse is associated with altered stress and alcohol craving responses. Treatment-engaged, 28-day abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals (ADs; 6F/22M), and social drinkers (SDs; 10F/18M) were exposed to a brief guided imagery of a personalized stressful, alcohol-related and neutral-relaxing situation, one imagery condition per session, presented in random order across 3 days. Alcohol craving, anxiety and emotion ratings, behavioral distress responses, heart rate, blood pressure, and salivary cortisol measures were assessed. Alcohol patients showed significantly elevated basal heart rate and salivary cortisol levels. Stress and alcohol cue exposure each produced a significantly enhanced and persistent craving state in alcohol patients that was marked by increased anxiety, negative emotion, systolic blood pressure responses, and, in the case of alcohol cue, behavioral distress responses, as compared to SDs. Blunted stress-induced cortisol responses were observed in the AD compared to the SD group. These data are the first to document that stress and cue exposure induce a persistent negative emotion-related alcohol craving state in abstinent alcoholics accompanied by dysregulated HPA and physiological arousal responses. As laboratory models of stress and negative mood-induced alcohol craving are predictive of relapse outcomes, one implication of the current data is that treatments targeting decreases in stress and alcohol cue-induced craving and regulation of stress responses could be of benefit in improving alcohol relapse outcomes.},

A first set of studies indicates that verbal working memory includes a storage component, which is implemented neurally by areas in the left-hemisphere posterior parietal cortex, and a subvocal rehearsal component, which is implemented by lefthemisphere speech areas, including Broca’s area as well as the premotor and supplementary motor areas. We provide a number of neuroimaging dissociations between the storage and rehearsal areas. A second set of studies focuses on spatial working memory and indicates that it is mediated by a network of predominantly right-hemisphere regions that include areas in posterior parietal, occipital, and frontal cortex. We provide some suggestive evidence that these areas, too, divide into storage and rehearsal regions, with right-hemisphere posterior parietal and premotor regions subserving spatial rehearsal. In a final set of studies, we turn to ‘‘executive processes,’’ metaprocesses that regulate the processing of working-memory contents. We focus on the executive process of inhibition as it is used in verbal working memory. We provide evidence that such inhibition is mediated by the left-hemisphere prefrontal region and that it can be dissociated from verbal storage and rehearsal processes.},

  abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology’s lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

  abstract = {The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.},

Of critical importance for clinical psychological science, EF impairments are associated with most forms of psychopathology. However, despite the proliferation of research on EF in clinical populations, with notable exceptions clinical and cognitive approaches to EF have remained largely independent, leading to failures to apply theoretical and methodological advances in one field to the other field and hindering progress. First, we review the current state of knowledge of EF impairments associated with psychopathology and limitations to the previous research in light of recent advances in understanding and measuring EF. Next, we offer concrete suggestions for improving EF assessment. Last, we suggest future directions, including integrating modern models of EF with state of the art, hierarchical models of dimensional psychopathology as well as translational implications of EF-informed research on clinical science.},

  abstract = {The primary goal of instruction should be to facilitate long-term learning?that is, to create relatively permanent changes in comprehension, understanding, and skills of the types that will support long-term retention and transfer. During the instruction or training process, however, what we can observe and measure is performance, which is often an unreliable index of whether the relatively long-term changes that constitute learning have taken place. The time-honored distinction between learning and performance dates back decades, spurred by early animal and motor-skills research that revealed that learning can occur even when no discernible changes in performance are observed. More recently, the converse has also been shown?specifically, that improvements in performance can fail to yield significant learning?and, in fact, that certain manipulations can have opposite effects on learning and performance. We review the extant literature in the motor- and verbal-learning domains that necessitates the distinction between learning and performance. In addition, we examine research in metacognition that suggests that people often mistakenly interpret their performance during acquisition as a reliable guide to long-term learning. These and other considerations suggest that the learning?performance distinction is critical and has vast practical and theoretical implications.},

  abstract = {The specificity with which past experiences can be remembered varies across the lifespan, possibly due to differences in how precisely information is encoded. Memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7–9 years), young adults (18–30 years), and older adults (65–76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, we distinguished memory for the specific items versus the general categories. We identified repetition suppression in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects, which did not differ between groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. Our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.},

  abstract = {Repeated exposure is assumed to promote long-term learning. This is demonstrated by the so-called ”Hebb-effect”: when short lists of verbal or spatial materials are presented sequentially for an immediate serial recall test, recall improves with list repetition. This repetition benefit, however, is not ubiquitous. Previous studies found little or no performance improvement for repetitions of visuospatial arrays (e.g., arrays of colored squares). Across eight experiments with college students and Prolific samples, we investigated which factors promote visuospatial learning by testing all combinations of variables distinguishing between visual-array tasks (brief + simultaneous presentation + a single recognition test) and tasks showing the Hebb effect (slow + sequential presentation + recall test probing all items). Participants profited from repetitions when all items were tested with a recall procedure, but not if the test consisted of recognition. Hence, the key to promote long-term learning is to recall all of the memorized information over the short-term.},

  abstract = {Objective: Deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) is characterized by deficits in self-regulating the physiological arousal caused by strong emotions. We examined whether a unique profile of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) would help identify DESR in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: Subjects included 197 children with ADHD and 224 children without ADHD. We defined DESR if a child had an aggregate cut-off score of {$>$} 180 but {$<$} 210 on the Anxiety/Depression, Aggression, and Attention scales of the CBCL (CBCL-DESR). This profile was selected because of: 1) its conceptual congruence with the clinical concept of DESR; and 2) because its extreme ({$>$} 210) form has been previously associated with severe forms of mood and behavioral dysregulation in children with ADHD. All subjects were comprehensively assessed with structured diagnostic interviews and a wide range of functional measures. Results: Forty-four percent of children with ADHD had a positive CBCL-DESR profile versus 2\% of controls (P {$<$} 0.001). The CBCL-DESR profile was associated with elevated rates of anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders, as well as significantly more impairments in emotional and interpersonal functioning. Conclusions: The CBCL-DESR profile helped identify a subgroup of children with ADHD who had a psychopathological and functional profile consistent with the clinical concept of DESR.},

The architecture of these brain networks can be examined and analyzed with a large variety of graph theory tools. Methods for detecting modules, or network communities, are of particular interest because they uncover major building blocks or subnetworks that are particularly densely connected, often corresponding to specialized functional components. A large number of methods for community detection have become available and are now widely applied in network neuroscience. This article first surveys a number of these methods, with an emphasis on their advantages and shortcomings; then it summarizes major findings on the existence of modules in both structural and functional brain networks and briefly considers their potential functional roles in brain evolution, wiring minimization, and the emergence of functional specialization and complex dynamics.},

  abstract = {There is substantial interest in identifying biobehavioral dimensions of individual variation that cut across heterogenous disorder categories, and computational models can play a major role in advancing this goal. In this report, we focused on efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA), a computationally characterized variable derived from sequential sampling models of choice tasks. We created an EEA factor from three behavioral tasks in the UCLA Phenomics dataset (n = 272), which includes healthy participants (n = 130) as well-participants with schizophrenia (n = 50), bipolar disorder (n = 49), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 43). We found that the EEA factor was significantly reduced in all three disorders, and that it correlated with an overall severity score for psychopathology as well as self-report measures of impulsivity. Although EEA was significantly correlated with general intelligence, it remained associated with psychopathology and symptom scales even after controlling for intelligence scores. Taken together, these findings suggest EEA is a promising computationally-characterized dimension of neurocognitive variation, with diminished EEA conferring transdiagnostic vulnerability to psychopathology.},

In this review, we integrate recent developments in the cognitive neuroscience of human memory retrieval, pinpointing the neural chronometry underlying successful recall. Electrophysiological recordings suggest that sensory cues proceed into the medial temporal lobe within the first 500~ms. At this point, a hippocampal process sets in, geared toward internal pattern completion and coordination of cortical memory reinstatement between 500 and 1500~ms. We further highlight the dynamic principles governing the recall process, which include a reversal of perceptual information flows, temporal compression, and theta clocking.},

  abstract = {Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

  abstract = {The neural correlates of memory formation in humans have long been investigated by exposing subjects to diverse material and comparing responses to items later remembered to those forgotten. Tasks requiring memorization of sensory sequences afford unique possibilities for linking neural memorization processes to behavior, because, rather than comparing across different items of varying content, each individual item can be examined across the successive learning states of being initially unknown, newly learned, and eventually, fully known. Sequence learning paradigms have not yet been exploited in this way, however. Here, we analyze the event-related potentials of subjects attempting to memorize sequences of visual locations over several blocks of repeated observation, with respect to pre- and post-block recall tests. Over centro-parietal regions, we observed a rapid P300 component superimposed on a broader positivity, which exhibited distinct modulations across learning states that were replicated in two separate experiments. Consistent with its well-known encoding of surprise, the P300 deflection monotonically decreased over blocks as locations became better learned and hence more expected. In contrast, the broader positivity was especially elevated at the point when a given item was newly learned, i.e., started being successfully recalled. These results implicate the Broad Positivity in endogenously-driven, intentional memory formation, whereas the P300, in processing the current stimulus to the degree that it was previously uncertain, indexes the cumulative knowledge thereby gained. The decreasing surprise/P300 effect significantly predicted learning success both across blocks and across subjects. This presents a new, neural-based means to evaluate learning capabilities independent of verbal reports, which could have considerable value in distinguishing genuine learning disabilities from difficulties to communicate the outcomes of learning, or perceptual impairments, in a range of clinical brain disorders.},

  abstract = {The relationship of visual P3a and P3b to age and neuropsychological performance was investigated in 26 healthy children (6.8–15.8 years) and 129 adult volunteers (20.0–88.8 years). Within the sample of children, an effect of age on midline topography was observed, with higher frontal amplitudes in the youngest compared to the oldest children. Increasing age was associated with lower P3a and P3b amplitude and shorter P3b latency at Fz. Performance on neuropsychological tests (matrix reasoning from WASI, digit span from WAIS, word order and hand movement from Kaufman) was only weakly associated with measures of P3a and P3b. The analyses were then repeated with the full life-span sample (n = 155). It was found that for P3a, amplitude decreased and latency increased with age. For P3b, the pattern was more complex, with a nonlinear amplitude reduction and no latency change with age. It appears that the development of P3a in children represents the start of processes that later continue in the adult life-span, but that the automatic processes indexed by P3a seems to mature earlier than the controlled processes reflected by P3b. Finally, it was demonstrated that the relationships between neuropsychological test scores (matrix reasoning, digit span) and P3 parameters were complex, following a mix of linear and nonlinear patterns. It is suggested that the neuropsychological significance of the different P3a and P3b parameters may change from childhood to the adult life-span.},

Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation and the critical features that determine the extent to which aging affects learning are still unknown. By using a visual sequence learning task, which consists of the repeated presentation of a simple sequence of tokens, we are able to track the progress of gradual memory formation through both neurophysiological and behavioral markers. On a neurophysiological level, we focused on two learning related centroparietal ERP components: the P300 and broad positivity.},

However, an increasing number of scientists are going in the opposite direction by utilizing opaque machine learning models to make predictions and draw inferences, suggesting that scientists are opting for models that have less potential for understanding. Are scientists trading understanding for some other epistemic or pragmatic good when they choose a machine learning model? Or are the assumptions behind why minimal models provide understanding misguided? In this paper, using the case of deep neural networks, I argue that it is not the complexity or black box nature of a model that limits how much understanding the model provides. Instead, it is a lack of scientific and empirical evidence supporting the link that connects a model to the target phenomenon that primarily prohibits understanding.},

Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Hypothesis-testing studies should be pre-registered and optimally raw data published.

  abstract = {Background. The P300 (P3) event-related potential (ERP) component, a possible endophenotype for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has been widely examined in children, but received little attention in adults. Our objective was to conduct a meta-analysis of P3 studies in adults with ADHD. Method. We searched the Medline and PsycINFO databases for controlled studies examining both adult ADHD and matched healthy controls. Six relevant publications were identified for the meta-analysis, which had comparable data across studies with regard to the amplitude of ERP components related to target detection (P3, P3b). Pooled effect size (ES) for P3 amplitude as well as the association of the ES with age and gender were investigated using meta-regression. Results. Comparing the ADHD group versus controls, the pooled effect size for a decrease in P3 amplitude was in the medium range (Cohen’s d=x0.55, p=0.0006). Additionally, meta-regression revealed that decrease in P3 amplitude significantly varied with the mean age of ADHD patients (p=0.0087), with a gradual increasing of the difference at higher ages. Results also showed a significant association between the ES and gender, indicating a more pronounced reduction of P3 amplitude in the ADHD group versus controls when females were predominantly represented in the sample. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of P3 characteristics in adults with ADHD. It reveals a significantly decreased P3 amplitude during target detection. Our result that the reduction in P3 amplitude increases with age is interpreted in a neurodevelopmental context.},

  abstract = {P300 as an effective biomarker to index attention and memory has been widely used for brain-computer interface, cognitive evaluation, and clinical diagnosis. To evoke clear P300, an oddball paradigm consisting of two types of stimuli, i.e., infrequent target stimuli and frequent standard stimuli, is usually used. However, to simply and quickly explore the P300-related process, previous studies predominately focused on the target condition but ignored the fusion of target and standard conditions, as well as the difference of brain networks between them. Therefore, in this study, we used the hidden Markov model to investigate the fused multi-conditional electroencephalogram dataset of P300, aiming to effectively identify the underlying brain networks and explore the difference between conditions. Specifically, the inferred networks, including their transition sequences and spatial distributions, were scrutinized first. Then, we found that the difference between target and standard conditions was mainly concentrated in two phases. One was the stimulation phase that mainly related to the cortical activities of the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule, and the other corresponded to the response phase that involved the activities of superior and medial frontal gyri. This might be attributed to distinct cognitive functions, as the stimulation phase is associated with visual information integration whereas the response phase involves stimulus discrimination and behavior control. Taken together, the current work explored dynamic networks underlying the P300-related process and provided a complementary understanding of distinct P300 conditions, which may contribute to the design of P300-related brain-machine systems.},

Neuroscience and education can interact directly, by virtue of considering the brain as a biological organ that needs to be in the optimal condition to learn (‘brain health’); or indirectly, as neuroscience shapes psychological theory and psychology influences education. In this article, we trace the origins of educational neuroscience, its main areas of research activity and the principal challenges it faces as a translational field. We consider how a pure psychology approach that ignores neuroscience is at risk of being misleading for educators. We address the major criticisms of the field comprising, respectively, a priori arguments against the relevance of neuroscience to education, reservations with the current practical operation of the field, and doubts about the viability of neuroscience methods for diagnosing disorders or predicting individual differences. We consider future prospects of the field and ethical issues it raises. Finally, we discuss the challenge of responding to the (welcome) desire of education policymakers to include neuroscience evidence in their policymaking, while ensuring recommendations do not exceed the limitations of current basic science.},

  abstract = {The key issue in analyzing brain substrates of memory is the nature of memory traces, how memories are formed, stored, and retrieved in the brain. In order to analyze mechanisms of memory formation it is first necessary to find the loci of memory storage, the classic problem of localization. Various approaches to this issue are reviewed. A particular strategy is proposed that involves a number of different techniques (electrophysiological recording, lesions, electrical stimulation, pathway tracing) to identify the essential memory trace circuit for a given form of learning and memory. The methods of reversible inactivation can be used to localize the memory traces within this circuit. Using classical conditioning of eye blink and other discrete responses as a model system, the essential memory trace circuit is identified, the basic memory trace is localized (to the cerebellum), and putative higher-order memory traces are characterized in the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {. Research in young adults has demonstrated that neurophysiological measures are able to provide insight into learning processes. However, to date, it remains unclear whether neurophysiological changes during learning in older adults are comparable to those in younger adults. The current study addressed this issue by exploring age differences in changes over time in a range of neurophysiological outcome measures collected during visuomotor sequence learning. Specifically, measures of electroencephalography (EEG), skin conductance, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and eye-related measures, in addition to behavioral performance measures, were collected in younger (Mage~=~27.24~years) and older adults (Mage~=~58.06~years) during learning. Behavioral responses became more accurate over time in both age groups during visuomotor sequence learning. Yet, older adults needed more time in each trial to enhance the precision of their movement. Changes in EEG during learning demonstrated a stronger increase in theta power in older compared to younger adults and a decrease in gamma power in older adults while increasing slightly in younger adults. No such differences between the two age groups were found on other neurophysiological outcome measures, suggesting changes in brain activity during learning to be more sensitive to age differences than changes in peripheral physiology. Additionally, differences in which neurophysiological outcomes were associated with behavioral performance on the learning task were found between younger and older adults. This indicates that the neurophysiological underpinnings of learning may differ between younger and older adults. Therefore, the current findings highlight the importance of taking age into account when aiming to gain insight into behavioral performance through neurophysiology during learning.},

  abstract = {Prior research has shown neurophysiological measures of learning yield large effect sizes, suggesting that these measures have high potential in providing insight into learning. Yet, most literature on learning and neurophysiological measures focused on a single outcome measure, neglecting the interplay between different types of measures. Additionally, it is not yet clear which measures change robustly in a way specific to the learning process. The current study assessed implicit visuomotor sequence learning through multiple neurophysiological outcome measures. In two experiments participants were presented with an arm-movement version of the Serial Reaction Time Task with blocks in which targets were selected in a repeating sequence and blocks in which targets were selected randomly. While participants were executing this task, measures of EEG, skin conductance, heart rate (variability) and respiration, in addition to measures of behavioral performance, were collected. Although behavioral performance was sensitive to sequence learning, as demonstrated by faster responses in sequence than in random blocks, neurophysiology was not sensitive to sequence learning. However, in both experiments, skin conductance level and parietal EEG alpha and gamma power were sensitive to task induction and changed during sequence blocks in the direction of a pre-task baseline and were related to behavioral performance. In general, models including only EEG parietal gamma power were just as powerful in explaining behavioral measures during learning as models including a combination of neurophysiological outcome measures. The findings of the current study demonstrate that neurophysiology is not sensitive to implicit sequence learning specifically, but that general learning effects on a visuomotor learning task are reflected in measures of neurophysiology. Additionally, the findings highlight that a combination of neurophysiological outcome measures is not necessarily better in explaining task learning than a single measure.},

  abstract = {Childhood and adolescence are critical stages of the human lifespan, in which fundamental neural reorganizational processes take place. A substantial body of literature investigated accompanying neurophysiological changes, focusing on the most dominant feature of the human EEG signal: the alpha oscillation. Recent developments in EEG signal-processing show that conventional measures of alpha power are confounded by various factors and need to be decomposed into periodic and aperiodic components, which represent distinct underlying brain mechanisms. It is therefore unclear how each part of the signal changes during brain maturation. Using multivariate Bayesian generalized linear models, we examined aperiodic and periodic parameters of alpha activity in the largest openly available pediatric dataset (N=2529, age 5-22 years) and replicated these findings in a preregistered analysis of an independent validation sample (N=369, age 6-22 years). First, the welldocumented age-related decrease in total alpha power was replicated. However, when controlling for the aperiodic signal component, our findings provided strong evidence for an age-related increase in the aperiodic-adjusted alpha power. As reported in previous studies, also relative alpha power revealed a maturational increase, yet indicating an underestimation of the underlying relationship between periodic alpha power and brain maturation. The aperiodic intercept and slope decreased with increasing age and were highly correlated with total alpha power. Consequently, earlier interpretations on age-related changes of total alpha power need to be reconsidered, as elimination of active synapses rather links to decreases in the aperiodic intercept. Instead, analyses of diffusion tensor imaging data indicate that the maturational increase in aperiodic-adjusted alpha power is related to increased thalamocortical connectivity. Functionally, our results suggest that increased thalamic control of cortical alpha power is linked to improved attentional performance during brain maturation.},

Recent work suggests WM is supported by a variety of information gating, updating, and removal processes, which ensure only task-relevant information occupies WM. Current neurocomputational theory suggests WM gating is accomplished via ‘go/no-go’ signalling in basal ganglia-thalamus-prefrontal cortex pathways, but is less clear about other subprocesses and brain structures known to play a role in WM. We review recent efforts to identify the neural basis of WM subprocesses using the recently developed reference-back task as a benchmark measure of WM subprocesses. Targets for future research using the methods of model-based cognitive neuroscience and novel extensions to the reference-back task are suggested.},

  abstract = {Large-scale databases of human activity in social media have captured scientific and policy attention, producing a flood of research and discussion. This paper considers methodological and conceptual challenges for this emergent field, with special attention to the validity and representativeness of social media big data analyses. Persistent issues include the over-emphasis of a single platform, Twitter, sampling biases arising from selection by hashtags, and vague and unrepresentative sampling frames. The sociocultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of “screen captures” for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media. Other challenges include accounting for field effects, i.e. broadly consequential events that do not diffuse only through the network under study but affect the whole society. The application of network methods from other fields to the study of human social activity may not always be appropriate. The paper concludes with a call to action on practical steps to improve our analytic capacity in this promising, rapidly-growing field.},

This claim is critically evaluated by reviewing research that has compared simple and complex span tasks in both experimental and correlational studies. In addition, a meta-analysis and re-analyses of key data sets were conducted. The review and analyses suggest that simple and complex span tasks largely measure the same basic subcomponent processes (e.g., rehearsal, maintenance, updating, controlled search) but differ in the extent to which these processes operate in a particular task. These differences largely depend on the extent to which phonological processes are maximized and variability from long list lengths is present. Potential methodological, psychometric, and assessment implications are discussed and a theoretical account of the data is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Unfortunately, no single factor has been shown to fully account for the relation between these two important constructs. In the current study we tested whether multiple factors (capacity, attention control, and secondary memory) would collectively account for the relation. A large number of participants performed multiple measures of each construct and latent variable analyses were used to examine the data. The results demonstrated that capacity, attention control, and secondary memory were uniquely related to WM storage, WM processing, and gF. Importantly, the three factors completely accounted for the relation between WM (both processing and storage) and gF. Thus, although storage and processing make independent contributions to gF, both of these contributions are accounted for by variation in capacity, attention control and secondary memory. These results are consistent with the multifaceted view of WM, suggesting that individual differences in capacity, attention control, and secondary memory jointly account for individual differences in WM and its relation with gF.},

  abstract = {Auxiliary hypotheses (AHs) are indispensable in hypothesis-testing, because without them specification of testable predictions and consequently falsification is impossible. However, as AHs enter the test along with the main hypothesis, non-corroborative findings are ambiguous. Due to this ambiguity, AHs may also be employed to deflect falsification by providing “alternative explanations” of findings. This is not fatal to the extent that AHs are independently validated and safely relegated to background knowledge. But this is not always possible, especially in the so-called “softer” sciences where often theories are loosely organized, measurements are noisy, and constructs are vague. The Systematic Replications Framework (SRF) provides a methodological solution by disentangling the implications of the findings for the main hypothesis and the AHs through pre-planned series of systematically interlinked close and conceptual replications. SRF facilitates testing alternative explanations associated with different AHs and thereby increases test severity across a battery of tests. In this way, SRF assesses whether the corroboration of a hypothesis is conditional on particular AHs, and thus allows for a more objective evaluation of its empirical support and whether post hoc modifications to the theory are progressive or degenerative in the Lakatosian sense. Finally, SRF has several advantages over randomization-based systematic replication proposals, which generally assume a problematic neo-operationalist approach that prescribes exploration-oriented strategies in confirmatory contexts.},

Phonological short-term memory is discussed as a case that illustrates a number of issues shared by other research domains in cognitive neuropsychology, with particular reference to memory systems.

  abstract = {Spatial working memory entails the ability to keep spatial information active in working memory over a short period of time. To study the areas of the brain that are involved in spatial working memory, a group of stroke patients was tested with a spatial search task. Patients and healthy controls were asked to search through a number of boxes shown at different locations on a touch-sensitive computer screen in order to find a target object. In subsequent trials, new target objects were hidden in boxes that were previously empty. Within-search errors were made if a participant returned to an already searched box; between-search errors occurred if a participant returned to a box that was already known to contain a target item. The use of a strategy to remember the locations of the target objects was calculated as well. Damage to the right posterior parietal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired the ability to keep spatial information ‘on-line’, as was indicated by performance on the Corsi Block-Tapping task and the within-search errors. Moreover, patients with damage to the right posterior parietal cortex, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampal formation bilaterally made more between-search errors, indicating the importance of these areas in maintaining spatial information in working memory over an extended time period.},

Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this paper, we present the Network Comparison Test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of 1) network structure, 2) edge (connection) strength, and 3) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: the Type I error rate is close to the nominal significance level, and power proves sufficiently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed.}

  abstract = {Context Cognitive load theory aims to develop instructional design guidelines based on a model of human cognitive architecture. The architecture assumes a limited working memory and an unlimited long-term memory holding cognitive schemas; expertise exclusively comes from knowledge stored as schemas in long-term memory. Learning is described as the construction and automation of such schemas. Three types of cognitive load are distinguished: intrinsic load is a direct function of the complexity of the performed task and the expertise of the learner; extraneous load is a result of superfluous processes that do not directly contribute to learning, and germane load is caused by learning processes that deal with intrinsic cognitive load. Objectives This paper discusses design guidelines that will decrease extraneous load, manage intrinsic load and optimise germane load. Discussion Fifteen design guidelines are discussed. Extraneous load can be reduced by the use of goal-free tasks, worked examples and completion tasks, by integrating different sources of information, using multiple modalities, and by reducing redundancy. Intrinsic load can be managed by simple-to-complex ordering of learning tasks and working from low- to high-fidelity environments. Germane load can be optimised by increasing variability over tasks, applying contextual interference, and evoking self-explanation. The guidelines are also related to the expertise reversal effect, indicating that design guidelines for novice learners are different from guidelines for more experienced learners. Thus, well-designed instruction for novice learners is different from instruction for more experienced learners. Applications in health professional education and current research lines are discussed. Medical Education 2010: 44: 85–93},

In order to quantify the processes that underlie performance on the BART, Wallsten, Pleskac, and Lejuez (2005) proposed a series of mathematical models whose parameters have a clear psychological interpretation. Here we examine a 2-parameter simplification of Wallsten et al.’s preferred 4-parameter model. A parameter recovery study shows that — with plausible restrictions on the number of participants and trials — both parameters (i.e., risk taking γ + and response consistency β) can be estimated accurately. To demonstrate how the 2-parameter model can be used in practice, we implemented a Bayesian hierarchical version and applied it to an empirical data set in which participants performed the BART following various amounts of alcohol intake.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To build a general knowledge base, it is imperative that individuals acquire, integrate, and further extend knowledge across experiences. For instance, in one episode an individual may learn that George Washington was the first president. In a separate episode they may then learn that Washington was the commander of the Continental Army. Integration of the information in memory may then support self-derivation of the new knowledge that the leader of the Continental Army was also the first president. Despite a considerable amount of fMRI research aimed at further elucidating the neuroanatomical regions supporting this ability, a consensus has yet to be reached with regards to the precise neurocognitive processes involved. In the present research, we capitalized on the high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs) to inform the time course of processes elicited during successful integration and further extension of new factual knowledge. Adults read novel, related stem facts and were tested for self-derivation of novel integration facts while ERPs were recorded. Consistent with current theoretical models, memory integration was first triggered by novelty detection within 400 msec of experience of a second, related stem fact. Two additional temporally staged encoding processes were then observed interpreted to reflect (1) explicit meaning comprehension and (2) representation of the integrated relation in memory. During the test for self-derivation, a single ERP was elicited, which presumably reflected retrieval and/or recombination of previously integrated knowledge. Together, the present research provides important insight into the time course of neurocognitive processing associated with the formation of a knowledge base.},

In this qualitative literature review, we address treatment seeking for AUD from a host of perspectives and summarize the literature on key factors. First, we summarize the rates of alcohol treatment seeking across various epidemiological surveys, spanning decades. Second, we discuss the definition of treatment seeking and ‘what’ is typically considered formal treatment. Third, we consider timing and discuss ‘when’ individuals are most likely to seek treatment. Fourth, we review the literature on ‘who’ is most likely to seek treatment, including demographic and clinical correlates. Fifth, we address the critical question of ‘why’ so few people receive clinical services for AUD, relative to the number of individuals affected by the disorder, and review barriers to treatment seeking at the treatment- and person-levels of analysis. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve treatment seeking rates by focusing on tangible points of intervention. Specifically, we recommend a host of adaptations to models of care including efforts to make treatment more appealing across stages of AUD severity, accept a range of health-enhancing drinking goals as opposed to an abstinence-only model, educate providers and consumers about evidence-based behavioral and pharmacological treatments, and incentivize the delivery of evidence-based services.},

  abstract = {Diverse psychological correlates have been ascribed to “P300,” the conspicuous P3b component of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded in many laboratory tasks. Traditionally, hypotheses on P3b have conceived of this component being independent from implementing the response to the present stimulus. This has changed in the recent decade when P3b has been related to aspects of the decision process. The present review first focusses on effects of the classic variables stimulus frequency and relevance on P3b amplitude. It turns out that already these effects are related to response requirements because effects of stimulus frequency actually are effects of frequency of response-defined stimulus categories and effects of relevance may be defined as effects of graduating the response requirements. Then, constructs and hypotheses on psychological functions reflected by P3b are evaluated for their abilities in explaining those effects. The tested constructs are information, relevance, and capacity, and the hypotheses are priming, cognitive processing, memory storage, context updating, closure, response facilitation, decision, stimulus–response (S–R) link reactivation, and conscious representations. S–R link reactivation hypothesis performed best, closely followed by memory storage and closure hypotheses. To make further progress, more studies should conduct tests between competing hypotheses.},

  abstract = {There are certain characteristics of psychopathy that may be related to changes in intertemporal choices. Specifically, traits such as impulsivity or lack of inhibitory control may be associated with a more pronounced discounting function in intertemporal choices (IC) and, in turn, this function may be based on changes in the basic mechanisms of time estimation (TE). Therefore, this study aimed to examine potential differences in neurophysiological correlates, specifically through N1, P3, and LPP measurements, which may be related to TE and IC, examining their modulation according to psychopathic traits, different emotional conditions, and different decision-making conditions. This experimental study included 67 adult participants (48 women) from the northern region of Portugal, who performed an intertemporal decision-making task and, of those, 19 participants (16 women), with a mean age of 25 years (SD = 5.41) and a mean of 16 years of schooling (SD = 3.37) performed the time estimation task. The instruments/measures applied were MoCA, used as a neurocognitive screening tool; the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM), a self-report instrument with 58 items that map the core features of psychopathy along three facets – boldness, meanness, and disinhibition – and considers them continuously distributed among the general population; intertemporal decision-making and time estimation tasks – for the time estimation task, the stimuli consisted of 45 color images extracted from the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS). In the TE task, there was an almost significant effect of disinhibition on the values of θ, with higher values on this variable associated with greater values of θ in the unpleasant emotional condition. In the IC task, there were no significant effects of any psychopathy measure on the values of the gains and losses ratios. In addition, the analysis of the neurophysiological correlates of the IC task did not reveal a main effect of the decision-making condition, nor effects of any psychopathy measure on the N1 and P3 amplitudes. The analysis of the neurophysiological correlates of the TE task revealed that higher meanness values are associated with smaller N1 amplitude in the pleasant emotional condition, whereas higher disinhibition values are associated with greater N1 amplitude in the pleasant emotional condition. Still in this task, higher disinhibition values were associated with a smaller LPP amplitude in the unpleasant emotional condition. The increase in the distribution of attention resources towards time and/or the increase in activation states, including those originated by responses to emotional stimuli, may be the main factor that alters the way impulsive individuals and, presumably, individuals with high psychopathy, consider time when making decisions. The scientific study of the biological basis of intelligence has been contributing to our understanding of individual differences in cognitive abilities for decades. In particular, the ongoing development of electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and genetic methods has created new opportunities to gain insights into pressing questions, allowing the field to come closer towards a comprehensive theory that explains how genotypes exert their influence on human intelligence through intermediate biological and cognitive endophenotypes. The aim of this article is to provide a focused overview of empirical benchmark findings on biological correlates of intelligence. Specifically, we summarize benchmark findings from electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and genetic research. Moreover, we discuss four open questions: (1) The robustness of research findings; (2) the relation between neural parameters and cognitive processes; (3) promising methodological developments; and (4) theory development. The aim of this paper is to assemble the most important and robust findings on the biological basis of intelligence to stimulate future research and to contribute to theory development. The P3b is an extensively studied neurophysiological phenomenon that is predominantly explained in the cognitive neuroscience literature as reflecting context updating, presumably in working memory (WM). Despite the prevalence and influence of the context updating hypothesis, direct empirical support for the role of WM updating in eliciting the P3b is still missing. The present study was designed to address the empirical gap in understanding the functional role of P3b in general, and specifically in relation to WM updating. A mass-univariate approach was used to test the unique contribution of WM updating, categorization, and stimulus probability to the P3b. The results indicated that the P3b is only modulated by the categorization process, a finding that challenges the WM updating hypothesis. Taken together these results, we suggest that the P3b reflects a WM guided target identification mechanism, which operates as part of a goal-directed learning strategy. The ability to exert cognitive control is a major function of the prefrontal cortex, the efficiency of which depends on the phasic release of norepinephrine (NE) at particular time points. However, different aspects of information are simultaneously processed at any given moment. This raises the question of whether the norepinephrine system is also capable of specifically modulating selected aspects of all ongoing information processing, especially when several of those processes are carried out by the same functional neuroanatomical structure at the same time. We examine this question in humans using a flanker paradigm by integrating neurophysiological (EEG) and pupil diameter data using novel signal processing techniques including Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE) and source localization. We show that during conflict monitoring, motor response-related processes are more strongly modulated by the NE system than stimulus-related processes or central decision processes between stimulus and response. This was the case even though these processes occurred at the same time point and were mediated by overlapping medial frontal cortical structures. The results indicate that the NE system exerts specific modulatory effects for different informational contents that are simultaneously processed in the medial frontal cortex. The P3 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) is large at posterior scalp sites with rare go stimuli (go-P3) and at anterior sites with rare no-go stimuli (no-go P3). Most hypotheses on P3, including our S-R link reactivation notion, imply that these characteristics are independent of specific response modes. This assumption was here investigated by comparing ERPs between key-pressing and covert counting responses in oddball tasks that required responses to either frequent or rare stimuli. Replicating previous results, topographic differences between parietal rare go-P3 and fronto-central rare no-go P3 were much reduced with counting compared to key-press responses. Besides, while go-P3 was generally more positive than no-go P3 in the key-press tasks (except for fronto-central no-go P3 with rare stimuli) the reverse was true in the counting tasks. Thus, the characteristic posterior and fronto-central go and no-go topographies appear to be specific to hand movements. Moreover, P3s evoked in counting tasks might not simply be P3 proper, uncontaminated by movement-related potentials, but rather the go/no-go logic might differ between counting and key-pressing, with the oddball effects being affected by specific processes implemented for these particular response modes. We compared the effect of locking the event-related potentials (ERPs) on the stimulus vs. the response in a simple (SRT) and in a discriminative (DRT, equally probable Go/No-go) visuo-motor task. The accurate alignment of stimulus- and response-locked ERPs on the same time scale was obtained selecting a group of 27 participants with low inter-individual response time (RT) variation in the two tasks to reduce the jitter of RTs. Two-second epochs were defined for the analyses based on averaged RTs in the two tasks. Results show that the preparatory pre-stimulus activities (i.e., the pN and the BP components) were not affected by the different locking in both SRT and DRT. As expected, the exogenous post-stimulus P1 and N1 components (and the P2, present only in SRT) were larger in stimulus- than response-locked averaging; the same trend was observed for the less-known prefrontal N1 and P1 components (pN1 and pP1) that were larger in stimulus-locked averaging (the effect was not significant in SRT). The prefrontal pP2 component was only present in DRT peaking around 370 ms, and did not show an effect of locking. The frontal-central N2 component was enhanced by response-locked averaging in SRT, while it did not show effects of locking in DRT. The P3 component peaked at about 350 ms over central sites in SRT, and at about 500 ms over parietal sites in DRT; in both cases its amplitude was larger in response- than in stimulus-locked averaging. Overall, the amplitude of the preparatory components was independent from locking, the exogenous components were enhanced by stimulus locking, and the late components were more related to the response than to the stimulus. Concluding, to investigate action preparation, perception, and perceptual-decisional activity ERP studies should adopt stimulus-locked averaging with an appropriate baseline and longer pre-stimulus interval, or use both types of locking.},

  abstract = {, Drug consumption is driven by a drug’s pharmacological effects, which are experienced as rewarding, and is influenced by genetic, developmental, and psychosocial factors that mediate drug accessibility, norms, and social support systems or lack thereof. The reinforcing effects of drugs mostly depend on dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic drug exposure triggers glutamatergic-mediated neuroadaptations in dopamine striato-thalamo-cortical (predominantly in prefrontal cortical regions including orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) and limbic pathways (amygdala and hippocampus) that, in vulnerable individuals, can result in addiction. In parallel, changes in the extended amygdala result in negative emotional states that perpetuate drug taking as an attempt to temporarily alleviate them. Counterintuitively, in the addicted person, the actual drug consumption is associated with an attenuated dopamine increase in brain reward regions, which might contribute to drug-taking behavior to compensate for the difference between the magnitude of the expected reward triggered by the conditioning to drug cues and the actual experience of it. Combined, these effects result in an enhanced motivation to “seek the drug” (energized by dopamine increases triggered by drug cues) and an impaired prefrontal top-down self-regulation that favors compulsive drug-taking against the backdrop of negative emotionality and an enhanced interoceptive awareness of “drug hunger.” Treatment interventions intended to reverse these neuroadaptations show promise as therapeutic approaches for addiction.},

  abstract = {Despite many developments in the methods of event-related potentials (ERPs), little attention has gone out to the statistical handling of ERP data. Trials are often averaged, and univariate or repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to test hypotheses. The aim of this study was to introduce mixed regression to ERP research and to demonstrate advantages associated with this method. Eighty-five healthy subjects received electrical pain stimuli with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) registration. Analyses first showed that results obtained with mixed regression analyses are highly comparable to those using repeated measures of ANOVA. Second, important advantages of the mixed regression technique were demonstrated by allowing the inclusion of persons with missing data, single trial analysis, non-linear time effects, time × person effects (random slope effects) and a within-subject covariate. Among others, the results showed a strong trial (habituation) effect, which contraindicates the common procedure of averaging of trials. Furthermore, the regression coefficients for intensity and trial varied significantly between persons, indicating individual differences in the effect of intensity and trial on the ERP amplitude. In conclusion, using mixed regression analysis as a statistical technique in ERP research will advance the science of unravelling mechanisms underlying ERP data.

The goal of the present study was to assess the impact of the school?s response, following an independent evaluation, for child and family school-related quality of life (QOL). We hypothesized that a positive school response would be associated with improved QOL. Parents completed the LDQOL/15, a brief measure of school-related QOL, at the time that their child received an independent evaluation and again a year later (N = 155). At follow-up, parents reported the tenor of the school?s response to the evaluation and whether special education services had changed. QOL problems were very high in this referred population, with 66\% of respondents rating a level of problems in the clinical range at baseline. Predicted interactions between time of assessment (baseline/follow-up) and the school?s response to the evaluation were confirmed for all outcome variables; a positive school response was associated with improved QOL. Nevertheless, the overall prevalence of school-related QOL problems remained high a year after the evaluation. These findings indicate that special education interventions can mitigate learning disabilities? impacts, but even with these services, many children with learning disorders and their families continue to be significantly affected.},

However, previous findings from P300 studies were inconsistent due to the heterogeneity of research methods, which make it difficult to understand the neurobiological significance of them. The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis on P300 in patients with BD. Method A literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify studies that compared P300 event-related potential between patients with BD and healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed P300 indices such as amplitude and latency of P3a and P3b in auditory or visual paradigms. Further, moderator analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of patient characteristics (i.e. history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories [BD-I/BD-II], and phase of illness [euthymic, manic, or depressive]) on P300 indices. Result Out of 124 initial records, we included 30 articles (BD: N\,=\,1331; HCs: N\,=\,1818). Patients with BD showed reduced P3a and P3b amplitude in both paradigms and delayed P3b latency in auditory paradigms compared to HCs. There was no influence on the history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories, or phase of illness on P300 indices. Limitation The difference in medication use was difficult to control and it may affect the results. Conclusion This meta-analysis provides evidence for P300 abnormalities in patients with BD compared to HCs. Our results suggest that P300 may be trait markers rather than state markers in this illness.},

Further, moderator analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of patient characteristics (i.e. history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories [BD-I/BD-II], and phase of illness [euthymic, manic, or depressive]) on P300 indices. Result: Out of 124 initial records, we included 30 articles (BD: N = 1331; HCs: N = 1818). Patients with BD showed reduced P3a and P3b amplitude in both paradigms and delayed P3b latency in auditory paradigms compared to HCs. There was no influence on the history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories, or phase of illness on P300 indices. Limitation: The difference in medication use was difficult to control and it may affect the results. Conclusion: This meta-analysis provides evidence for P300 abnormalities in patients with BD compared to HCs. Our results suggest that P300 may be trait markers rather than state markers in this illness.},

  abstract = {Studies of the event-related potentials (ERPs) P3a/P3b have given insights into age effects on cognitive processes in the brain, and it has been established that latency increases and amplitude decreases with age. However, if latency jitter, that is, variation in single trial latencies, is larger in elderly than in younger participants, this may create an artificial age–amplitude correlation. The aim of this article is to test whether correction for latency jitter affects the P3a/P3b age correlations. One hundred thirty-three healthy adults (20–88 years old) went through a 3-stimuli visual oddball paradigm. Latency jitter was corrected by use of a Maximum Likelihood Estimation method. The results showed that corrections for latency jitter did not significantly affect the correlations between P3a/P3b and age. It is concluded that previous reports of amplitude reduction as a function of age seem to be valid regardless of whether latency jitter correction has been applied.},

According to a longstanding view, the P300, and particularly its posterior subcomponent (i.e., the P3b), is driven by stimulus categorization. Whether the P3b relates to tactical processes involved in immediate responding or strategic processes that affect future behavior remains controversial, however. It is difficult to determine whether variability in P3b latencies relates to variability in response times because of limitations in the methods currently available to quantify the latency of the P3b during single trials. In this paper, we report results from the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), the Hitchcock Radar Task, and a 3-Stimulus Oddball Task. These represent variants of the one-, two-, and three-stimulus oddball paradigms commonly used to study the P3b. The PVT requires simple detection, whereas the Hitchcock Radar Task and the 3-Stimulus Task require detection and categorization. We apply a novel technique that combines hidden semi-Markov models and multi-voxel pattern analysis (HSMM-MVPA) to data from the three experiments. HSMM-MVPA revealed a processing stage in each task corresponding to the P3b. Trial-by-trial variability in the latency of the processing stage correlated with response times in the Hitchcock Radar Task and the 3-Stimulus Task, but not the PVT. These results indicate that the P3b reflects a stimulus categorization process, and that its latency is strongly associated with response times when the stimulus must be categorized before responding. In addition to those theoretical insights, the ability to detect the onset of the P3b and other components on a single-trial basis using HSMM-MVPA opens the door for new uses of mental chronometry in cognitive neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Background: Dysregulation Profile (DP) describes the psychopathological construct of concurrent impairments in the ability to regulate emotion, behaviour, and cognition measured by the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Such transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology play an important role in addition to core symptoms of psychiatric diagnosis in clinical practice. Evaluation of DP in children with different mental disorders may improve our understanding and treatment of both contents. Methods: 911 clinically referred children between 6 and 18 years were investigated. The sample consisted of five ‘pure’ disorders groups, i.e., tic disorder (TIC), anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and two comorbid disorder group, i.e., ADHD + TIC and ADHD + oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). DP level and latent structure were compared across groups. Results: The rate of severe/abnormal dysregulation rates varied from 15 \% to 44 \% when the 210 cut-off was used, and 5 \% to 18 \% when stringent cut-off was used (i.e. -{$>$}70 on all DP-subscales). The most affected population were children with comorbid ADHD with ODD/TIC, while least were those with TIC only. Five different latent phenotypes of DP were found. Conclusion: DP above clinical cut-off level widely exists in clinically referred children in parallel to core symptoms of their diagnosis, especially among children with comorbidities. During clinical assessment it would be worth to clarify the role of DP-related problems within the general psychosocial impairment of the patient to improve a personalized approach.},

Especially in larger scale studies using a multitude of individual EEG-based tasks, the quality of latency measures often suffers from high and low frequency noise residuals due to the resulting low trial counts (because of compressed tasks) and because of the limited feasibility of visual inspection of the large-scale data. In the present study, we systematically evaluated two different approaches to latency estimation (peak latencies and fractional area latencies) with respect to their data quality and the application of noise reduction by jackknifing methods. Additionally, we tested the recently introduced method of Standardized Measurement Error (SME) to prune the dataset. We demonstrate that fractional area latency in pruned and jackknifed data may amplify within-subjects effect sizes dramatically in the analyzed data set. Between-subjects effects were less affected by the applied procedures, but remained stable regardless of procedure.},

  abstract = {Event probability has been traditionally regarded as the major determinant of P3b amplitudes, with amplitudes increasing when stimuli are less likely. Here we show in a simple variant of the continuous performance task that this "oddball effect" does not universally apply. Stimuli were a continuous series of (A or B) -{$>$} (X or Y) pairs, with the letter X requiring a key-press response and occurring in 80\% of trials after A and in 20\% after B (vice versa the Y). P3b amplitudes were equally large with probable and improbable occurrence of X. This was in contrast to visual Mismatch Negativity which was consistently larger with less probable stimuli, and also in contrast to no-go P3 amplitudes, which were larger with improbable than probable Y. The only effect on P3b amplitude was due to stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA): P3b was larger with SOAs of 2000~ms compared to 1500~ms. This result dovetails with previous evidence in the oddball task that the main determinant of the oddball effect is not event probability but rather time interval between stimuli. The absence of probability effects on P3b was in sharp contrast to the presence of these effects on no-go P3. Implications are discussed for theories about the psychological meaning of the P3b component.},

These policies encourage authors to avoid bar graphs and use graphics that show the data distribution; however, they provide little guidance on how to effectively display data. We conducted a systematic review of studies published in top peripheral vascular disease journals to determine what types of figures are used, and to assess the prevalence of suboptimal data visualization practices. Among papers with data figures, 47.7\% of papers used bar graphs to present continuous data. This primer provides a detailed overview of strategies for addressing this issue by (1) outlining strategies for selecting the correct type of figure depending on the study design, sample size, and the type of variable; (2) examining techniques for making effective dot plots, box plots, and violin plots; and (3) illustrating how to avoid sending mixed messages by aligning the figure structure with the study design and statistical analysis. We also present solutions to other common problems identified in the systematic review. Resources include a list of free tools and templates that authors can use to create more informative figures and an online simulator that illustrates why summary statistics are meaningful only when there are enough data to summarize. Last, we consider steps that investigators can take to improve figures in the scientific literature.},

To this end, we examined connectivity within the lateral fronto-parietal network (LFPN) and its relation to reasoning ability in 132 children and adolescents aged 6–18 years, 56 of whom were scanned twice over the course of 1.5 years. Developmental changes in strength of connections within the LFPN were most prominent in late childhood and early adolescence. Reasoning ability was related to functional connectivity between left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), but only among 12–18-year olds. For 9–11-year olds, reasoning ability was most strongly related to connectivity between left and right RLPFC; this relationship was mediated by working memory. For 6–8-year olds, significant relationships between connectivity and performance were not observed; in this group, processing speed was the primary mediator of improvement in reasoning ability. We conclude that different connections best support reasoning at different points in development and that RLPFC-IPL connectivity becomes an important predictor of reasoning during adolescence.},

However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest—in some cases approaching 100\%—when sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application (http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing SEM-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.},

  abstract = {Secondary data analysis, or the analysis of preexisting data, provides a powerful tool for the resourceful psychological scientist. Never has this been more true than now, when technological advances enable both sharing data across labs and continents and mining large sources of preexisting data. However, secondary data analysis is easily overlooked as a key domain for developing new open-science practices or improving analytic methods for robust data analysis. In this article, we provide researchers with the knowledge necessary to incorporate secondary data analysis into their methodological toolbox. We explain that secondary data analysis can be used for either exploratory or confirmatory work, and can be either correlational or experimental, and we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of this type of research. We describe how transparency-enhancing practices can improve and alter interpretations of results from secondary data analysis and discuss approaches that can be used to improve the robustness of reported results. We close by suggesting ways in which scientific subfields and institutions could address and improve the use of secondary data analysis.},

We highlight efforts to overcome current challenges by focusing on the emerging field of computational psychiatry, which might enable the field to move from a symptom-based description of mental illness to descriptors based on objective computational multidimensional functional variables. We survey recent efforts toward this goal and describe a set of methods that together form a toolbox to aid this research program. We identify four levels in computational psychiatry: (a) behavioral tasks that index various psychological processes, (b) computational models that identify the generative psychological processes, (c) parameter-estimation methods concerned with quantitatively fitting these models to subject behavior by focusing on hierarchical Bayesian estimation as a rich framework with many desirable properties, and (d) machine-learning clustering methods that identify clinically significant conditions and subgroups of individuals. As a proof of principle, we apply these methods to two different data sets. Finally, we highlight challenges for future research.},

In this work, we introduce exploratory and confirmatory Bayesian tests for partial correlations. For the former, we first extend the customary GGM formulation that focuses on conditional dependence to also consider the null hypothesis of conditional independence for each partial correlation. Here a novel testing strategy is introduced that can provide evidence for a null, negative, or positive effect. We then introduce a test for hypotheses with order constraints on partial correlations. This allows for testing theoretical and clinical expectations in GGMs. The novel matrix-F prior distribution is described that provides increased flexibility in specification compared to the Wishart prior. The methods are applied to PTSD symptoms. In several applications, we demonstrate how the exploratory and confirmatory approaches can work in tandem: hypotheses are formulated from an initial analysis and then tested in an independent dataset. The methodology is implemented in the R package BGGM.},

  abstract = {Human learning, at least in part, appears to be dependent on the evaluation of how outcomes of our actions align with our expectations. Over the past 23 years, electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to probe the neural signatures of feedback processing. Seminal work demonstrated a difference in the human event-related potential (ERP) dependent on whether people were processing correct or incorrect feedback. Since then, these feedback evoked ERPs have been associated with reinforcement learning and conflict monitoring, tied to subsequent behavioral adaptations, and shown to be sensitive to a wide range of factors (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Recently, research has turned to frequency decomposition techniques to examine how changes in the EEG power spectra are related to underlying learning mechanisms. Although the literature on the neural correlates of feedback processing is vast, there are still methodological discrepancies and differences in results across studies. Here, we provide reference results and an investigation of methodological considerations for the ERP (reward positivity) and frequency (delta and theta power) correlates of feedback evaluation with a large sample size. Specifically, participants (n = 500) performed a two-armed bandit task while we recorded EEG. Our findings provide key information about the data characteristics and relationships that exist between the neural signatures of feedback evaluation. Additionally, we conclude with selected methodological recommendations for standardization of future research. All data and scripts are freely provided to facilitate open science.},

  abstract = {An important goal for psychological science is developing methods to characterize relationships between variables. Customary approaches use structural equation models to connect latent factors to a number of observed measurements, or test causal hypotheses between observed variables. More recently, regularized partial correlation networks have been proposed as an alternative approach for characterizing relationships among variables through off-diagonal elements in the precision matrix. While the graphical Lasso (glasso) has emerged as the default network estimation method, it was optimized in fields outside of psychology with very different needs, such as high dimensional data where the number of variables (p) exceeds the number of observations (n). In this article, we describe the glasso method in the context of the fields where it was developed, and then we demonstrate that the advantages of regularization diminish in settings where psychological networks are often fitted (p≪n). We first show that improved properties of the precision matrix, such as eigenvalue estimation, and predictive accuracy with cross-validation are not always appreciable. We then introduce nonregularized methods based on multiple regression and a nonparametric bootstrap strategy, after which we characterize performance with extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate that the nonregularized methods can be used to reduce the false-positive rate, compared to glasso, and they appear to provide consistent performance across sparsity levels, sample composition (p/n), and partial correlation size. We end by reviewing recent findings in the statistics literature that suggest alternative methods often have superior performance than glasso, as well as suggesting areas for future research in psychology. The nonregularized methods have been implemented in the R package GGMnonreg.},

Socioeconomic disadvantage confers risk for less adaptive learning-related behaviors at school entry, yet substantial variability in school readiness exists within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Investigation of neurophysiological systems associated with learning-related behaviors in high-risk populations could illuminate resilience processes. This study examined the relevance of a neurophysiological measure of controlled attention allocation, amplitude of the P3b event-related potential, for learning-related behaviors and academic performance in a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged kindergarteners. The sample consisted of 239 children from an urban, low-income community, approximately half of whom exhibited behavior problems at school entry (45\% aggressive/oppositional; 64\% male; 69\% African American, 21\% Hispanic). Results revealed that higher P3b amplitudes to target stimuli in a go/no-go task were associated with more adaptive learning-related behaviors in kindergarten. Furthermore, children’s learning-related behaviors in kindergarten mediated a positive indirect effect of P3b amplitude on growth in academic performance from kindergarten to 1st grade. Given that P3b amplitude reflects attention allocation processes, these findings build on the scientific justification for interventions targeting young children’s attention skills in order to promote effective learning-related behaviors and academic achievement within socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.},

The literature on time perception and impulsivity, however, is not clear cut and needs a better theoretical foundation. Here, we develop the theoretical background on concepts of time perception, which could lead to an empirically based notion of the association between an altered sense of time and impulsivity.},

Consistent with earlier reports, Ericsson and colleagues concluded that heuristic models (specifically their novel intertemporal choice heuristic or ITCH model) explain intertemporal choices better than discounting models do. More surprisingly, their results showed that all discounting models performed nearly at chance level, and did not outperform even the baseline model. In this article, however, we demonstrate that these conclusions are premature. Specifically, we reanalyzed the Ericson et al. (2015) data under different, arguably more appropriate, conditions and found that models of both classes are rather good at predicting choice. We conclude that the jury is still out on which (type of) model is best and end by making suggestions towards conducting more informative model comparisons.}

We conducted an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study to investigate the effects of substance use on delay discounting in a sample of people who use stimulants (HIV+: 30; HIV−: 34). Participants completed multiple EMAs throughout the day for 28 days. The EMAs collected data on delay discounting and substance use (time since last substance use and level of intoxication). Delay discounting was assessed using a brief Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ). Analyses were conducted using linear mixed effects modeling. Most participants (99.1\%) used cocaine as their primary stimulant. Among participants without HIV, MCQ score remained relatively stable during the first 2 hr after stimulant use, followed by an increase during 2–6 hr (p {$<$} .05), before decreasing again. For alcohol and marijuana, the MCQ score was stable during the first 4 hr after use, with a sharp increase at 4–6 hr (p {$<$} .05), before decreasing again. Among participants with HIV, there were no changes in MCQ score as a function of time since recent substance use. These findings provide evidence of a plausible connection between delay discounting and acute withdrawal that may have relevance for risky behaviors.

Also, few studies have explored WM training effects on children using event-related potentials. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of WM training in children, including the effects on behavioral performance and neurophysiological outcomes. Methods Forty-four healthy children (mean age = 7.76 years, SD = 0.57 years, 18 females) were assigned to the training and control groups. Over 20 training sessions, the training group participated in the computation-span and spatial N-back tasks, whereas the control group joined in normal class activities. They all completed the pre- and post-test evaluation of WM tasks (digit span backwards task and N-back task). Results The results showed that WM training led to improved performance in the digit span backwards task and 2-back task of post-test evaluation, shortened P3a and P3b latencies in nontarget trials during the spatial 1-back task, shortened P3a latency in target and nontarget trials, as well as increased P3b amplitude and shortened P3b latency in target trials during the spatial 2-back task. Conclusions These results suggested that WM training might enhance children's behavioral performance on WM tasks and brought about neurophysiological changes. This study gives insights into the potential of WM training effects on children's behavioral performance and neurophysiological outcomes.},

  abstract = {Working memory is a fundamental feature of biological brains for perception, cognition, and learning. In addition, learning with working memory, which has been show in conventional artificial intelligence systems through recurrent neural networks, is instrumental to advanced cognitive intelligence. However, it is hard to endow a simple neuron model with working memory, and to understand the biological mechanisms that have resulted in such a powerful ability at the neuronal level. This article presents a novel self-adaptive multicompartment spiking neuron model, referred to as SAM, for spike-based learning with working memory. SAM integrates four major biological principles including sparse coding, dendritic non-linearity, intrinsic self-adaptive dynamics, and spike-driven learning. We first describe SAM’s design and explore the impacts of critical parameters on its biological dynamics. We then use SAM to build spiking networks to accomplish several different tasks including supervised learning of the MNIST dataset using sequential spatiotemporal encoding, noisy spike pattern classification, sparse coding during pattern classification, spatiotemporal feature detection, meta-learning with working memory applied to a navigation task and the MNIST classification task, and working memory for spatiotemporal learning. Our experimental results highlight the energy efficiency and robustness of SAM in these wide range of challenging tasks. The effects of SAM model variations on its working memory are also explored, hoping to offer insight into the biological mechanisms underlying working memory in the brain. The SAM model is the first attempt to integrate the capabilities of spike-driven learning and working memory in a unified single neuron with multiple timescale dynamics. The competitive performance of SAM could potentially contribute to the development of efficient adaptive neuromorphic computing systems for various applications from robotics to edge computing.},

  abstract = {Psychology has historically been concerned, first and foremost, with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior. Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology?s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned – that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology –the linear mixed model – I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers’ actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the “random effect” formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology’s ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

The RDoC framework comprises 39 functional constructs designed to be revised and refined, with the overall goal of improving diagnostic validity and treatments. This study aimed to reach a consensus among experts in the addiction field on the ‘primary’ RDoC constructs most relevant to substance and behavioural addictions. Methods Forty-four addiction experts were recruited from Australia, Asia, Europe and the Americas. The Delphi technique was used to determine a consensus as to the degree of importance of each construct in understanding the essential dimensions underpinning addictive behaviours. Expert opinions were canvassed online over three rounds (97\% completion rate), with each consecutive round offering feedback for experts to review their opinions. Results Seven constructs were endorsed by ≥ 80\% of experts as ‘primary’ to the understanding of addictive behaviour: five from the Positive Valence System (reward valuation, expectancy, action selection, reward learning, habit); one from the Cognitive Control System (response selection/inhibition); and one expert-initiated construct (compulsivity). These constructs were rated to be related differentially to stages of the addiction cycle, with some linked more closely to addiction onset and others more to chronicity. Experts agreed that these neuropsychological dimensions apply across a range of addictions. Conclusions The study offers a novel and neuropsychologically informed theoretical framework, as well as a cogent step forward to test transdiagnostic concepts in addiction research, with direct implications for assessment, diagnosis, staging of disorder, and treatment.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition affecting information processing across domains. The current meta-analysis investigated whether slower processing speed is associated with the ASD neurocognitive profile and whether findings hold across different time-based tasks and stimuli (social vs. nonsocial; linguistic vs. nonlinguistic). Mean RTs of ASD and age-matched neurotypical comparison groups (N = 893 ASD, 1063 neurotypical; mean age ASD group = 17 years) were compared across simple RT, choice RT, and interference control tasks (44 studies, 106 effects) using robust variance estimation meta-analysis. Simple RT\,tasks required participants to respond to individual stimuli, whereas choice RT tasks required forced-choice responses to two or more stimuli. Interference control tasks required a decision in the context of a distractor or priming stimulus; in an effort to minimize inhibitory demands, we extracted RTs only from baseline and congruent conditions of such tasks. All tasks required nonverbal (motor) responses. The overall effect-size estimate indicated significantly longer mean RTs in ASD groups (g = .35, 95\% CI = .16; .54) than comparison groups. Task type moderated effects, with larger estimates drawn from simple RT tasks than interference control tasks. However, across all three task types, ASD groups exhibited significantly longer mean RTs than comparison groups. Stimulus type and age did not moderate effects. Generalized slowing may be a domain-general characteristic of ASD with potential consequences for social, language, and motor development. Assessing processing speed may inform development of interventions to support autistic individuals and their diverse cognitive profiles.},

  abstract = {A critical aspect of inferential reasoning is the ability to form relationships between items or events that were not experienced together. This review considers different perspectives on the role of the hippocampus in successful inferential reasoning during both memory encoding and retrieval. Intuitively, inference can be thought of as a logical process by which elements of individual existing memories are retrieved and recombined to answer novel questions. Such flexible retrieval is sub-served by the hippocampus and is thought to require specialized hippocampal encoding mechanisms that discretely code events such that event elements are individually accessible from memory. In addition to retrieval-based inference, recent research has also focused on hippocampal processes that support the combination of information acquired across multiple experiences during encoding. This mechanism suggests that by recalling past events during new experiences, connections can be created between newly formed and existing memories. Such hippocampally mediated memory integration would thus underlie the formation of networks of related memories that extend beyond direct experience to anticipate future judgments about the relationships between items and events. We also discuss integrative encoding in the context of emerging evidence linking the hippocampus to the formation of schemas as well as prospective theories of hippocampal function that suggest memories are actively constructed to anticipate future decisions and actions.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely used for the detection of anxiety because of its ability to reflect the functional activities of the brain. However, EEG alone may not provide precision in the detection of anxiety because other emotional disorders usually trigger the same changes in brain function. To discover effective diagnostic indicators and to achieve more precise anxiety detection, we integrate eye movement information into EEG and divide the features into groups according to their respective characteristics. Then, we use group sparse canonical correlation analysis (GSCCA) to investigate group structure information among EEG and eye movement features and obtain an effective fusion representation of EEG and eye movement to achieve more precise detection of anxiety mood. The experimental results from 45 anxious subjects and 47 normal controls from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset showed that GSCCA could be effectively used to explore the correlation between EEG features within different scalp regions and eye movement features from several aspects. Visual behaviors, including saccades and fixation, are more linearly related to the power spectrum of EEG on the scalp area corresponding to the visual region of the brain. The ultimate fusion representation achieved an optimal classification accuracy of 82.70 percent with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the gamma band of EEG.},

  abstract = {Background It is difficult to distinguish between bipolar disorder (BD) and unipolar disorder (UD) depression. Given the different pattern of cognitive impairments between BD and UD, P300 is potentially useful for the differential diagnosis. This meta-analysis was performed to estimate the extent of difference in P300 in patients with BD versus UD depression. Methods Studies comparing P300 between depressed BD and UD patients with or without healthy controls (HCs) were retrieved from major English and Chinese databases. Studies with BD and UD samples that were comparable in terms of age, gender, and depression severity, were rated as having high quality. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) of P300 latency and amplitude were calculated. Results In total, eight studies with a total of 397 depressed BD patients, 390 depressed UD patients, and 497 HCs, were included. Among included studies, six were rated as having good quality and three followed BD (n\,=\,146) and UD (n\,=\,144) patients during remission. BD patients had significantly longer P300 latency than UD patients during major depressive episode [SMD (95\%CI): 0.580 (0.309, 0.850)] and remission [SMD (95\%CI): 1.583 (1.322, 1.844)]. Compared to HCs, remitted BD patients still had significantly longer P300 latency [SMD (95\%CI): 0.857 (0.059, 1.656)] but P300 latency of remitted UD patients had decreased to normal [SMD (95\%CI): 0.536 (−0.272, 1.343)]. Limitations Sample sizes of depressed and remitted patients with BD and UD of included studies are small. Conclusions P300 latency can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic marker for differentiating BD from UD depression.},

  abstract = {A multitude of psychological and social factors likely contribute to the development and maintenance of addictive disorders. As different people develop different addictions, it is important to understand whether psychosocial factors are related differently to different types of addictive disorders. In this study, we examined the unique interaction of personality traits, family environment, and life events in predicting substance (drugs, alcohol) and behavioral (gambling, sex) addictive disorders, among 207 participants suffering from an addictive disorder and 79 controls. Results identified several psychosocial factors, including impulsivity and reported negative life events, that predicted all types of addictive disorders. There was also a unique prediction model for each addiction. Drug and alcohol use disorders were predicted by lower agreeableness and less intellectual-cultural family orientation, with alcohol use disorder further predicted by lower extraversion and higher family organization. Gambling disorder was predicted by a family with lower intellectual-cultural orientation and higher organization and control, whereas compulsive sexual behavior was predicted by lower extraversion and agreeableness and higher neuroticism, and by higher family control. These findings suggest that the complex interplay among psychosocial factors is manifested differently across addictive disorders and may thus have important implications for research, prevention, and intervention.},

  abstract = {According to DSM 5, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various topics that occupies the majority of the subject’s time for a period of at least six months. The aforementioned state causes distress and/or functional impairments. This paper presents the outcomes of a pilot study that evaluated the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and CBT with an SSRIs intervention program. The participants comprised 16 children and adolescents with GAD (8 males and 8 females) matched with 16 typically developing peers (8 males and 8 females) aged from 10 to 16 years old (M = 12.56 SD = 2.18). Baseline assessment consisted of event related potentials (ERPs), which indicated that participants with GAD presented cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as they exhibited longer P300 latencies. Following treatment with the CBT program and/or medication, children and adolescents with GAD did not present statistically significantly longer P300 latencies and reaction times in comparison to the control group. Lastly, children and adolescents who followed the CBT program or the CBT program with psychopharmacological assistance did not reveal statistically significant differences in 13 out of 15 topographic brain areas and in reaction time.},
